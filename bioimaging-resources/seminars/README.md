# ðŸŸ¤ OMERO Resources

## **OMERO Support for Bioimaging Data Management at reNEW**

**OMERO** is a specialized, open-source bioimaging data management platform developed by the Open Microscopy Environment (OME). It is designed to support the **storage, annotation, visualization, sharing, and analysis** of complex, high-resolution microscopy data. At reNEW, OMERO will be deployed in **Winter 2025** as a dedicated solution for managing the full lifecycle of imaging data generated by the centerâ€™s stem cell and biomedical research activities.

***

## **Why OMERO Matters for reNEW**

As a research center focused on **regenerative medicine and stem cell biology**, reNEW generates vast amounts of high-content imaging dataâ€”from live-cell time-lapse microscopy to 3D confocal stacks and spatial transcriptomics. These datasets are large, heterogeneous, and often produced across different platforms, formats, and research groups. OMERO provides a **centralized, FAIR-aligned system** that addresses these challenges by:

* Ingesting and standardizing raw image files in vendor-neutral formats
* Storing associated experimental metadata, annotations, and region-of-interest (ROI) definitions
* Enabling access-controlled sharing among collaborators within and across labs
* Supporting structured archival for long-term preservation and data reuse
* Integrating with analysis pipelines, visualization tools, and image-based AI workflows

***

## **Use Cases at reNEW**

OMERO at reNEW will serve **two primary functions**:

1. **Offboarding of Departing Researchers**\
   OMERO ensures that valuable microscopy datasets generated by researchers who leave the center remain **well-organized, searchable, and reusable**. This supports institutional knowledge continuity, prevents data loss, and ensures alignment with reNEWâ€™s long-term data stewardship goals.
2. **Integration into Active Research Workflows**\
   Beyond offboarding, OMERO is designed to support **ongoing imaging-intensive projects**. Researchers can ingest, manage, annotate, and share microscopy data in daily research activities. Benefits include:
   * Improved **reproducibility** through structured metadata capture
   * Enhanced **data integrity** via centralized, secure storage
   * Streamlined **collaboration** through controlled data access
   * Greater **compliance** with funder and publisher requirements for data transparency

***

## **Strategic Role within reNEWâ€™s RDM Infrastructure**

The deployment of OMERO complements and extends reNEWâ€™s broader **Research Data Management (RDM) ecosystem**, which includes tools like REDCap, LabGuru, and structured N-drive storage. OMERO fills a crucial gap by bringing imaging data into compliance with FAIR principles and aligning with the data lifecycle expectations of funders such as Horizon Europe, the ERC, and the Novo Nordisk Foundation.

The OMERO system will be integrated with:

* **Local NAS** at reNEW for short-term image staging
* **High-throughput imaging workstations** for direct transfer and analysis
* **KU IT infrastructure** (DanHPC, KU Datasets, Database Store) for long-term storage, backup, and access security

This infrastructure supports seamless progression from microscope to metadata-enriched archival and enables researchers to scale imaging projects while maintaining robust, compliant data management practices.

## **Support and Onboarding**

If you are interested in using OMERO for your project, offboarding legacy imaging data, or integrating your workflows into the OMERO platform, please reach out for support or guidance.
