# ðŸŸ¤ Microscopy Tutorials

### **Essential Microscopy Tutorials and Protocols** &#xNAN;_&#x43;ommunity-Curated by GerBI-GMB_

### Introduction

The GerBI-GMB (German BioImaging - Society for Microscopy and Image Analysis) community has curated a valuable collection of short educational videos and detailed protocols. These resources guide best practices in microscopy, helping users maintain, calibrate, and optimize their instruments for high-quality imaging. Below is a summary of key tutorials, direct access to each video, and accompanying protocols.

### 1. **How to Measure a Point Spread Function (PSF)**

**Purpose**: Determine the lateral and axial resolution of your microscope.

* **Video**: [How to Measure a PSF â€“ Nico Stuurmann (iBiology)](https://www.ibiology.org/techniques/point-spread-function/)
* **Protocol**: [QUAREP-LiMi Protocol for PSF Measurement](https://quarep.org/protocols/psf/)

This video includes bead slide preparation and optimal acquisition settings. QUAREP-LiMi provides a detailed written protocol that includes image acquisition and analysis steps.

### 2. **How to Clean Objective Lenses and Filters**

**Purpose**: Maintain optical performance by safely removing dust and residues.

* **Video**: [Cleaning Lenses and Filters â€“ Kurt Thorn (iBiology)](https://www.ibiology.org/techniques/cleaning-microscope-objectives/)

Learn to inspect and clean optical components without damaging their surfaces, ensuring sustained image clarity and protection of expensive parts.

### 3. **How to Find the Focal Plane**

**Purpose**: Accurately focus on the specimen without harming it.

* **Video**: [Finding the Focal Plane â€“ Ron Vale (iBiology)](https://www.ibiology.org/techniques/finding-focal-plane/)

This tutorial provides tips on achieving focus smoothly, minimizing risks to both sample and objective lenses.

### 4. **How to Set Up Koehler Illumination**

**Purpose**: Achieve even illumination across the specimenâ€™s focal plane.

* **Video**: [Koehler Illumination Setup â€“ Ron Vale (iBiology)](https://www.ibiology.org/techniques/koehler-illumination/)

Understand the principle of Koehler illumination and follow a step-by-step alignment of lamp and condenser.

### 5. **Live Cell Imaging and Environmental Control**

**Purpose**: Ensure viability and reproducibility in live-cell imaging.

* **Video**: [Environmental Control in Live Cell Imaging â€“ Kurt Thorn (iBiology)](https://www.ibiology.org/techniques/environmental-control/)

Explore strategies for maintaining temperature, humidity, and COâ‚‚ levels, ranging from basic to advanced setups.

### 6. **How to Minimize Photobleaching and Phototoxicity**

**Purpose**: Protect live samples from light-induced damage during imaging.

* **Video**: [Reducing Photobleaching and Phototoxicity â€“ Ron Vale (iBiology)](https://www.ibiology.org/techniques/photobleaching-phototoxicity/)

Learn about minimizing light exposure and reactive oxygen species in fluorescence imaging experiments.

### 7. **How to Calibrate a Camera**

**Purpose**: Optimize camera performance through quantitative calibration.

* **Video**: [Camera Calibration â€“ Nico Stuurmann (iBiology)](https://www.ibiology.org/techniques/camera-calibration/)

This video walks you through:

* Capturing dark images
* Estimating readout noise and dark current
* Generating flat field images
* Measuring photon conversion factor and full well capacity
