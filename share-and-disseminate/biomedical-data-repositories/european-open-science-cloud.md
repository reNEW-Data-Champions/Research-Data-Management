## **European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) â€“ Researcher Overview**

## **What is EOSC?**

The **European Open Science Cloud** is a European Commission initiative that provides a **federated, open, and trusted digital environment** for managing, sharing, and reusing research data, publications, software, and related services.\
It is built on **FAIR principles**â€”ensuring research outputs are **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable**â€”and supports **Open Science** across all disciplines.

## **What EOSC Offers to Researchers**

* **Data Management** â€“ Tools for creating Data Management Plans (DMPs) that meet funder requirements.
* **FAIR-Compliant Publishing** â€“ Repositories and services for openly sharing datasets, publications, and software.
* **Storage & Compute** â€“ Secure storage, large-scale data transfer, high-performance computing (HPC), cloud services, and interactive notebooks.
* **Analysis & Collaboration** â€“ Analytical tools, container platforms, and collaborative workspaces for interdisciplinary projects.
* **Discovery & Reuse** â€“ Access to a growing catalogue of datasets, services, and tools across scientific domains.

## **High-Level Components of EOSC**

1. **EOSC Portal** â€“ The main entry point for discovering datasets, services, and resources.
2. **EOSC EU Node** â€“ The first operational platform that provides computing, storage, collaboration tools, and a reference model for other EOSC nodes.
3. **Federated Infrastructure** â€“ Connected national, thematic, and institutional nodes forming the EOSC Federation.
4. **Repositories & Services** â€“ FAIR-aligned repositories, storage solutions, HPC systems, and analysis platforms.
5. **Governance & Community** â€“ Coordinated by the EOSC Association, with input from EU Member States, research organisations, and service providers.

\
EOSC gives researchers a single gateway to **store, share, discover, and analyse research data and tools across Europe**, while meeting **Open Science** and **FAIR** requirements for projects funded by the EU and beyond
