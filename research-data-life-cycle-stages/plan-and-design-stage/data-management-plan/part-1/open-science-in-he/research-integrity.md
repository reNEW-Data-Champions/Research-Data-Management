# Research Integrity

Horizon Europe beneficiaries must respect the fundamental principles of research integrity:

* Reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the methodology, the analysis, and the use of resources
* Honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting, and communicating research in a transparent, fair, and unbiased way
* Respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage, and the environment
* Accountability for the research from idea to publication, for its management and organization, for training, supervision, and mentoring, and its broader impacts

Beneficiaries must ensure that persons carrying out research tasks follow good research practices, including ensuring, where possible, openness, reproducibility, and traceability, and refrain from the research integrity violations described in the **Code of Conduct**.
