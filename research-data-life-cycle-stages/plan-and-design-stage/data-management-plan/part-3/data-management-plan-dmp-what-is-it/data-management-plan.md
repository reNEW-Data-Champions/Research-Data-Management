# Data Management Plan:

The **goal** of a data management plan is to consider the many aspects of:

* Data management (throughout the research data lifecycle)
* Metadata generation (documentation of your data)
* Data preservation (storage, archiving, and publishing)
* Analysis before the project begins

**This leads to data being better managed and prepared for preservation in the future.**

Note: The DMP is a **living document** that should be updated (yearly)!
