#### <mark style="color:blue;">Overview: Who Is the RDMkit For?</mark>

The ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit) is a community-driven resource aimed at helping life scientists manage research data more effectively following the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Designed to encompass each stage of the research data lifecycle, the RDMkit offers practical methods, tools, and advice for researchers, data managers, and policymakers. However, not every stage will be relevant to everyone.

* **For Researchers**: RDMkit is a one-stop shop for data management guidance, examples, and best practices, including tips on preparing data management plans for grant proposals.
* **For Data Managers**: The kit provides structured, life science‚Äìspecific resources that can complement institutional services, supporting a consistent approach to research data management.
* **For Funding Agencies & Policymakers**: RDMkit offers evidence-based practices that promote cost-effectiveness and efficiency by improving how researchers handle data. It is recommended in the _Horizon Europe Program Guide_ as a reference for ‚ÄúData Management guidelines and good practices for the Life Sciences.‚Äù

At reNEW, both early-career and experienced investigators can utilize RDMkit to enhance their data practices. This resource is especially beneficial for reNEW Data Champions, who assist the wider research community adhere to FAIR data standards.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Why Are the FAIR Principles Needed?</mark>

As life science research generates increasingly large, complex datasets, **FAIR principles** ensure these datasets remain accessible, reproducible, and interpretable:

1. **Findability**: Clear labeling and robust metadata allow other researchers (and machines) to locate relevant data.
2. **Accessibility**: Well-managed repositories and standardized formats ensure data remain available over time.
3. **Interoperability**: Consistent file formats and metadata standards combine data across different projects, disciplines, or software tools.
4. **Reusability**: Thorough documentation, clear licensing, and version control make validating or extending previous work easier.

By applying FAIR principles, reNEW researchers and Data Champions can increase the visibility, impact, and longevity of scientific outputs, benefiting local teams and the wider life science community.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">What Does the RDMkit Aim to Achieve?</mark>

RDMkit is designed to help researchers:

* **Plan and Document**: Provide robust Data Management Plans (DMPs) and continuous documentation, meeting funder requirements (e.g., _Horizon Europe_).
* **Improve Efficiency**: Access targeted tools and workflows, reducing time spent on data wrangling and focusing more on experimental or analytical tasks.
* **Enhance Collaboration**: Share standardized data more easily among colleagues and across institutions, driving multidisciplinary innovation.
* **Support Sustainable Practices**: Adopt workflows that minimize duplication of effort, increase reproducibility, and optimize data storage costs.

For reNEW‚Äôs **Data Champions**, the RDMkit offers authoritative examples and resources that can be adapted into local training sessions, workflows, or institutional guidelines.
