# ðŸŸ¢ Organizing Your Data

## &#x20;2.1 **Organizing Your Data**

Organized data underpins robust, reproducible research. This sub-theme delivers best practices across multiple levels: from file naming conventions, version control protocols, and hierarchical folder structures to ready-to-use README templates and batch renaming tools. A new highlight is domain-specific **Sequencing Data Templates**, which provide structured naming, metadata frameworks, and folder hierarchies tailored for 10X scRNAâ€‘Seq, bulk RNAâ€‘Seq, ChIPâ€‘Seq/ATAC, CUT\&RUN/CUT\&TAG, and whole-genome sequencing, ensuring that even complex experimental data is FAIR-ready from the outset.
