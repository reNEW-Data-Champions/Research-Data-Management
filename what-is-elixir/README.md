# üü¢ RDM Support Resources

## **RDM Support Resources (ELIXIR Kits)**

The ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit) is a community-driven resource designed to help life scientists manage research data more effectively per the FAIR principles‚Äîmaking data **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable**. Covering each stage of the research data lifecycle, the RDMkit offers practical guidance, tools, and methods for researchers, data managers, and policymakers. While comprehensive, not every section will be equally relevant to all users.

* **For Researchers:** RDMkit serves as a one-stop resource for data management guidance, offering best practices, real-world examples, and tips on preparing data management plans for grant applications.
* **For Data Managers:** It provides structured, life science‚Äìspecific resources that can complement institutional services, supporting consistent, high-quality approaches to research data management.
* **For Funding Agencies and Policymakers:** RDMkit promotes evidence-based practices that enhance cost-effectiveness and efficiency in data management. It is specifically recommended in the _Horizon Europe Programme Guide_ as a reference for ‚ÄúData Management guidelines and good practices for the Life Sciences.‚Äù

At **reNEW**, both early-career and experienced investigators are encouraged to use RDMkit to strengthen their data practices. This resource is especially valuable for **reNEW Data Champions**, who support the broader research community in adopting and promoting FAIR data standards
