# Education and Skills

Open Science requires a shift in the skill sets of researchers, educators, and support staff. This includes developing expertise in data management, open-access publishing, research integrity, and collaboration. Institutions should provide training and support to equip researchers and staff with the necessary skills to engage in Open Science practices and integrate these principles into curricula for future scientists.
