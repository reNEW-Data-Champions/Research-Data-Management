## Evaluate and Archive Stage:

The fourth Stage of data management is archiving. Data archiving is " identifying and moving inactive data out of current production systems and into specialized long-term archival storage systems." This serves two objectives: 1) moving inactive data out of active systems and databases to optimize current performance, and 2) storing static data in specialized archival systems that are more cost-effective and allow for retrieval when needed. A data archive may also be called a data vault.&#x20;

Permanent retention, or archiving, implies ongoing migration of electronic formats and storage costs, as well as care, maintenance, and access services for the records in perpetuity. This differs from ensuring long-term storage or preservation of research data and takes significant investment for a faculty.

Long-term storage and preservation ensure that research data will be available to those seeking it in a persistent and accessible format for the specific period outlined by your funder and parent faculty. These Data Retention periods also allow for a measured period to pass so that a better assessment of the long-term impact of a research project can be evaluated.
