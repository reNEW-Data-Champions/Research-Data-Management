## Create a Data Management PlanCreate a Data Management PlanPlan & Design Stage:

Here you will identify the data collected or used to answer your research question and plan for data management throughout the lifecycle. This is the Stage at which a data management plan would be created. Many public funders of research ask for a data management plan to be submitted as part of a research application. A DMP might be informal, used internally, or guided by [UCPH policies](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/Documents/UCPHPolicyforResearchDataManagement2022-EN.pdf) established by the head of a research lab, collaborators, or IT groups across your faculty. Some funding agencies or projects might require the submission of formal DMPs.

During a project, everyone on the research team should know where the data reside, how to access them, and how they are organized and documented so they are readily usable by the team. DMPs can be updated and revised during the project - a DMP is a living document.
