# ðŸŸ¢ Informational Videos

This section features informational videos and training materials designed to support researchers in developing effective data management practices. Practical videos on organizing research data include strategies for consistent file naming, folder hierarchies, version control, and documentation to enhance findability and reproducibility. An introductory video on the OMERO Bioimaging Data Management Solution offers an overview of its capabilities for storing, annotating, and sharing large-scale microscopy data, with details on how this platform will be available for use at the University in late 2025 to support structured bioimaging data workflows.

Additional resources include a video tailored specifically for the reNEW research community, addressing data management practices relevant to stem cell and regenerative medicine research, and an e-learning course that broadly explores the importance of good research data management (RDM). This course highlights principles such as FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data, ethical and legal considerations, and best practices across disciplines. Finally, the section offers access to a recorded EU Horizon Europe DMP webinar, which provides detailed guidance on meeting European Commission requirements for Data Management Plans, helping researchers ensure compliance in Horizon Europe projects.
