# ðŸŸ¡ Genomics Templates

The Genomics section includes Data Management Plan (DMP) templates specifically designed for projects involving 10X single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), bulk RNA sequencing, and related high-throughput genomics approaches. These templates address the challenges of managing large, complex, and often sensitive datasets, including guidance on sample metadata standards, quality control documentation, ethical approvals for human data, secure storage and transfer of raw and processed data, and plans for long-term sharing in controlled-access repositories. By outlining these critical elements, the templates support researchers in developing thorough, consistent, and ethically sound data management strategies tailored to advanced genomics workflows.
