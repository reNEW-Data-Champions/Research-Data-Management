## Data Management Planning

### **Understanding the Research Data Lifecycle**

Effective research data management begins with thoughtful planning and continues throughout the entire research lifecycle. The Research Data Lifecycle is a framework that outlines the major stages involved in managing data, from initial planning to final sharing and reuse. It helps researchers organize, safeguard, and share data in a structured and sustainable way.

### The Research Data Lifecycle

The lifecycle typically consists of the following key stages:

* **Plan and Design**\
  Define your data needs, documentation standards, storage solutions, and team responsibilities before data collection begins.
* **Collect and Create**\
  Generate or acquire data using agreed-upon protocols, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and proper documentation.
* **Store and Manage**\
  Ensure data integrity, version control, security, and accessibility throughout the active phase of the research project.
* **Analyze**\
  Process and analyze data while maintaining a structured organization and traceability.
* **Preserve and Archive**\
  Safeguard final datasets for long-term retention using appropriate formats and metadata standards.
* **Share and Publish**\
  Disseminate data through trusted repositories or platforms while considering licensing, access, and ethical obligations.
* **Access and Reuse**\
  Enable future discovery and reuse by ensuring that data is findable, well-described, and appropriately licensed.

**Note: While these stages are often presented as a linear sequence, data management is rarely linear in practice. Researchers often move back and forth between stages as the project evolves.**

### What is a Data Management Plan (DMP)?

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that outlines how data will be handled throughout a research project's lifecycle. It describes data collection, storage, documentation, sharing, security, and long-term preservation procedures.

DMPs are increasingly required by funding agencies and research institutions. They can vary in complexity, from internal team documents to formal submissions for external grants. A well-developed DMP is a living document that can be revised as a project progresses.

## Why DMPs Matter

A well-crafted DMP:

* Ensures clear communication and role allocation within the research team
* Enhances the findability, quality, and long-term value of research data
* Promotes data sharing and research transparency
* Helps anticipate and address ethical, legal, and technical challenges
* Conserves time, funding, and effort through proactive planning
* Fulfills institutional and funder requirements (e.g., Horizon Europe, ERC)

By encouraging structured data management, a DMP contributes to research integrity and increases the potential impact of your research outcomes.

## Key Questions to Consider When Writing a DMP

When developing a DMP, consider the following:

* Will you need a Data Use Agreement to obtain or share data?
* What metadata and documentation standards will you follow?
* What are your institutionâ€™s and funderâ€™s data management expectations?
* Are you collecting new data or reusing existing data?
* What kind of data will you generate, and in what formats?
* What is the expected volume of data?
* Will you need to track versions of your data?
* What is your storage strategy for active data, and what is your backup policy?
* How will you store and archive data after the project ends?
* How will you organize, name, and describe your data files?
* What are your plans for making the data accessible to others?
* Are there any privacy, consent, security, or intellectual property considerations?
* Who on your team is responsible for each data management task?
* Have you allocated sufficient budget for data management activities?

## Support Available

Support is available if you need guidance on writing your DMP or managing any aspect of your data. Contact Richard Dennis, Data Steward for reNEWâ€”Copenhagen Node, for personalized assistance. In-person consultations are available every Wednesday from 14:00 to 15:00 or by appointment.
