## **Plan & Design Stage**

At this stage, you define which data will be collected, created, or reused to answer your research questions and plan how they will be managed across the entire research lifecycle. A central output is the **Data Management Plan (DMP)**, a planning tool and a compliance requirement.

For researchers at **reNEW**, DMPs should follow the [**University of Copenhagen Research Data Management Policy**](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/Documents/UCPHPolicyforResearchDataManagement2022-EN.pdf)**,** ensuring that all data are **FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)**.

* **EU and National Funders:**
  * **Horizon Europe**, **ERC**, and other EU funders require a formal DMP submission for funded projects, typically within the project's first 6â€“12 months.
  * Danish funders may accept simplified or internal DMPs, but increasingly encourage alignment with **FAIR and Open Science** principles.
* **Internal UCPH / reNEW Practice:**
  * A DMP is strongly recommended to guide data collection, storage, access control, and metadata practices even for projects without a formal funder requirement.
  * DMPs should incorporate **UCPH-approved storage solutions** (e.g., **UCPH ERDA**, **REDCap**, or high-security storage for sensitive data) and identify how sensitive or personal data will be handled under **GDPR** compliance.

During the project, **all team members** should know:

1. **Where the data is stored** (including primary storage and backups)
2. **Who can access the data** (permissions and authentication requirements)
3. **How the data is organized and documented** (file naming, folder structures, metadata, and README files)

DMPs are **living documents**. They should be reviewed and updated as new data are generated, new collaborators join, or requirements from **UCPH, reNEW, or EU funders** change. A well-maintained DMP supports compliance, data security, and eventual open sharing in line with **European and institutional Open Science policies**.
