Each stage of the Research Data Lifecycle is intrinsically linked to data storage management. Maintaining proper storage throughout the lifecycle is crucial for ensuring data security and compliance with recommended safety protocols. As research projects involve increasingly complex arrangements for the storage and transmission of data, robust data privacy and security planning are essential for protecting the confidentiality of research subjects and securing sensitive, personally identifiable information.

This guide highlights the various data storage and collaboration options available for research projects at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). I will discuss the features and limitations of each storage solution, focusing on their applications for research data management and sharing among UCPH employees and external collaborators.
