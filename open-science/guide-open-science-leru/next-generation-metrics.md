# Next Generation Metrics

Traditional research assessment metrics, such as the Journal Impact Factor, have limitations and can lead to biases in evaluating research outputs. Next-generation metrics focus on alternative, more comprehensive methods to assess the quality and impact of research, considering factors like societal impact, data sharing, and collaboration. These metrics aim to provide a more balanced and nuanced understanding of research performance, encouraging researchers to engage in open and collaborative practices.
