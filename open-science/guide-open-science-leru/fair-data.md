# FAIR Data

FAIR data stands for data that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. This principle ensures that scientific data is appropriately managed, stored, and shared to maximize its potential for discovery and reuse. This requires the development and adoption of common standards, metadata, and identifiers that facilitate data discovery and access while promoting collaboration and reducing duplication of effort.
