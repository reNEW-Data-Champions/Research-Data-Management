# Citizen Science

Citizen science is the active involvement of the general public in scientific research, typically through data collection, analysis, or problem-solving. This approach increases public engagement, fosters scientific literacy, and helps to address complex research questions by leveraging the power of large-scale participation. Institutions should provide support, resources, and training to enable citizen science projects and maximize their potential impact.
