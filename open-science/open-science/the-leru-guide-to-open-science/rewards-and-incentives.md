# Rewards and Incentives

To promote Open Science, it is essential to create rewards and incentives that recognize and support researchers who engage in open practices. This may involve revising promotion and tenure criteria, incorporating open science achievements into grant applications and evaluations, and recognizing non-traditional research outputs like data sets, software, and public engagement.
