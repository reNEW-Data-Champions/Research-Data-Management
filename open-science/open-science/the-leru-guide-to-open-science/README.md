# The LERU\* Guide to Open Science

Open Science is an evolving and multifaceted concept that aims to make scientific knowledge more accessible, transparent, reproducible, and inclusive to benefit society and the scientific community. As a member of the League of European Research Universities (LERU), the University of Copenhagen adheres to the eight pillars of Open Science set forth by LERU, providing a comprehensive framework for institutions and researchers to adopt open practices.

In addition to LERU's perspective, other organizations such as FOSTER (Facilitate Open Science Training for European Research) and UNESCO have also contributed to the understanding and promoting Open Science. FOSTER defines Open Science as an umbrella term encompassing "the opening up of the research cycle, increasing transparency, and sharing at each stage." This includes open access to publications, research data, open-source software, open collaboration, peer review, educational resources, and citizen science.

On the other hand, UNESCO defines Open Science as "the movement to make scientific research and data accessible to all." This includes free access to research articles, data, and resources, fostering global collaboration, and sharing knowledge. UNESCO aims to create a common international understanding of Open Science, promoting its adoption across nations and disciplines.

Integrating the perspectives of LERU, FOSTER, and UNESCO, Open Science can be understood as a comprehensive approach to scientific research that promotes accessibility, transparency, inclusivity, and reproducibility at all research cycle stages. The University of Copenhagen, as a member of LERU, follows the eight pillars of Open Science as a framework for implementing open practices while also considering the broader definitions and principles put forth by FOSTER and UNESCO. By embracing Open Science, the University of Copenhagen and other institutions worldwide can enhance collaboration, public engagement, and the societal impact of scientific research.

The League of European Research Universities (LERU) has identified eight pillars of Open Science that are crucial for its successful implementation. These pillars are:

1. [FAIR Data](fair-data.md)
2. [Research Integrity](research-integrity.md)
3. [Next Generation Metrics](next-generation-metrics.md)
4. [Future of Scholarly Communication](future-of-scholarly-communication.md)
5. [Citizen Science](citizen-science.md)
6. [Education and Skills](education-and-skills.md)
7. [Rewards and Incentives](rewards-and-incentives.md)
8. [European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](european-open-science-cloud-eosc.md)
