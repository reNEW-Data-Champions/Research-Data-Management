# 🟣 Open Science - LERU

{% hint style="danger" %}
Below is a **comprehensive set of definitions and explanations** for the **eight LERU pillars of Open Science**, drawn from LERU’s publications and interpretations by member institutions. These are the currently accepted frameworks for how research-intensive universities (such as the University of Copenhagen) should conceptualize and implement Open Science.

<table><thead><tr><th width="224">Pillar</th><th>Definition / Core Elements</th><th>Key Challenges &#x26; Considerations</th><th>Sources / Further Reading</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>FAIR Data</strong></td><td>Data that are <strong>Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable</strong>: implies use of persistent identifiers, rich metadata, standard formats, open access (as much as possible), and clear licensing or usage conditions.</td><td>Ensuring metadata quality, balancing openness vs privacy / confidentiality, establishing domain standards, avoiding “dark data” or data silos, data stewardship capacity.</td><td>LERU “Open Science and its role in universities” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/publications/open-science-and-its-role-in-universities-a-roadmap-for-cultural-change?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>); LERU “Implementing Open Science” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/files/Implementing-open-science.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Research Integrity</strong></td><td>Upholding ethical, transparent, and accountable conduct in all stages of research: e.g. avoidance of misconduct, reproducibility, clear authorship, data provenance, and conflict of interest handling.</td><td>Reconciling openness with confidentiality (e.g. sensitive human data), ensuring truthful reporting and correction, embedding integrity training, handling errors transparently.</td><td>LERU “Implementing Open Science” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/files/Implementing-open-science.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>); LERU “Open Science and its role” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/publications/open-science-and-its-role-in-universities-a-roadmap-for-cultural-change?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Next Generation Metrics</strong></td><td>Alternative or expanded metrics beyond traditional bibliometrics — incorporating open science contributions (data, software, altmetrics, societal impact) to assess research quality more holistically.</td><td>Avoiding misuse or overemphasis on metrics, discipline differences, gaming risks, ensuring fairness, integration into evaluation and promotion systems.</td><td>LERU “Open Science and its role” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/publications/open-science-and-its-role-in-universities-a-roadmap-for-cultural-change?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>); LERU “Implementing Open Science” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/files/Implementing-open-science.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Future of Scholarly Communication</strong></td><td>Transitioning the modes of producing, reviewing, disseminating, and archiving research outputs: e.g. open access publishing, preprints, open peer review, interoperable repositories, new publishing models.</td><td>Economic sustainability (publishing costs), publisher business models, copyright and licensing, discipline norms, repository interoperability.</td><td>LERU “Open Science and its role” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/publications/open-science-and-its-role-in-universities-a-roadmap-for-cultural-change?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>); LERU “Implementing Open Science” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/files/Implementing-open-science.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Citizen Science</strong></td><td>Involving members of the public (non-specialists) in scientific research (data collection, analysis, idea generation), thereby enhancing engagement, inclusivity, and societal relevance of research.</td><td>Quality control, training, ethical considerations, data validation, incentives, governance of citizen contributions, diversity and equity in participation.</td><td>LERU “Open Science and its role” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/publications/open-science-and-its-role-in-universities-a-roadmap-for-cultural-change?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>); LERU “Implementing Open Science” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/files/Implementing-open-science.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education and Skills</strong></td><td>Ensuring that researchers, students, and support staff have the competencies to deploy Open Science practices: e.g. training in FAIR data, open publishing, reproducible workflows, integrity, and metadata standards.</td><td>Resource allocation, embedding in curricula, continuous updating (keeping pace with evolving tools and standards), motivating uptake among established researchers.</td><td>LERU “Implementing Open Science” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/files/Implementing-open-science.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>); UCL summary of 8 Pillars (<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/open-science-research-support/open-science/8-pillars-open-science?utm_source=chatgpt.com">University College London</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rewards and Incentives</strong></td><td>Reforming academic recognition and reward systems to value open science practices (data sharing, reproducibility, code, public engagement) on par with traditional outputs like papers.</td><td>Institutional inertia in promotion criteria, resistance from researchers accustomed to classical metrics, aligning incentives with quality rather than quantity, balancing discipline differences.</td><td>LERU “Open Science and its role” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/publications/open-science-and-its-role-in-universities-a-roadmap-for-cultural-change?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>); LERU “Implementing Open Science” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/files/Implementing-open-science.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)</strong></td><td>A federated digital ecosystem that enables seamless access, management, analysis, and reuse of research data across Europe, connecting institutional infrastructures, services, and standards.</td><td>Technical interoperability, governance across institutions/countries, sustainability, data sovereignty, legal and policy harmonization, adoption and integration with institutional systems.</td><td>LERU “Implementing Open Science” (<a href="https://www.leru.org/files/Implementing-open-science.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">leru.org</a>);
