# Interoperability

Interoperability refers to the ability of data to be easily integrated, exchanged, and understood across different systems, tools, and applications.

* I1. Use standardized data formats, such as CSV, JSON, or XML, to ensure that various tools and applications can read and process data.
* I2. Adopt controlled vocabularies, ontologies, or thesauri for data annotation and description to ensure consistency and enable semantic interoperability.
* I3. Provide detailed and machine-readable metadata to help users understand and process the data.
* I4. Establish clear data models and schema to define the data elements' structure, relationships, and meaning.
