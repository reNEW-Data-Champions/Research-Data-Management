## DMP Templates

This section provides Data Management Plan (DMP) templates designed to support researchers in meeting institutional and funder requirements. The University of Copenhagen standard DMP template aligns with local policies and facilitates clear documentation of data management practices for internal review. For EU-funded research, dedicated templates are available for ERC, Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Actions, Horizon Europe, and Horizon 2020 projects, structured to address the specific planning and compliance expectations set by the European Commission. These templates support consistent, transparent articulation of data collection, documentation, sharing, and preservation strategies in line with funder policies.

A separate section focuses on Genomics DMP templates, reflecting the particular demands of research involving large-scale, sensitive, or identifiable data. These templates include guidance on managing consent and ethical approvals, handling sensitive data securely, applying appropriate metadata standards, and planning for long-term access via controlled repositories. By organizing these resources by research context and regulatory framework, the site aims to assist researchers in developing robust, funder-compliant plans that address the practical and ethical dimensions of managing research data.
