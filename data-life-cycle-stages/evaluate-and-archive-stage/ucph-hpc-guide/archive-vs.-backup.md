# ⚪ Archive vs. Backup

## **Data Archiving vs Data Backup – Comparison Table**

| **Aspect**            | **Data Archiving**                                                                                                                                           | **Data Backup**                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Purpose**   | **Long-term retention** of data no longer in active use but still valuable for **future reference, verification, or regulatory compliance**.                 | **Short- to medium-term recovery** to restore data after **loss, corruption, or disaster** and ensure operational/business continuity.           |
| **Typical Frequency** | **Infrequent**, based on data age, inactivity, or project milestones (e.g., end of data collection or project phase).                                        | **Regular and scheduled** – often **daily, weekly, or monthly** – to capture the latest data changes.                                            |
| **Accessibility**     | Stored in **slower, cost-efficient, or offline** systems; **not intended for immediate access**.                                                             | Stored on **fast-access systems** to enable **quick recovery** when needed.                                                                      |
| **Data Lifespan**     | Retained **indefinitely or per institutional/funder policy** until reviewed for deletion.                                                                    | Limited lifespan, governed by **backup retention policies**; older backups may be deleted or overwritten by new ones.                            |
| **Storage Medium**    | **Long-term, cost-effective solutions** (e.g., tape libraries, ERDA archival tiers, national research data vaults).                                          | **Fast, high-availability storage** (e.g., hard drives, SSD arrays, dedicated backup appliances, or cloud backup services).                      |
| **Use Case**          | Supports **long-term preservation and regulatory compliance** for inactive research data aligned with **UCPH, reNEW, and EU funder retention requirements**. | Provides **rapid data recovery** to protect against short-term **data loss events** such as accidental deletion, corruption, or system failures. |
| **Key Benefit**       | **Ensures verifiable, reusable, and compliant long-term storage** for research data.                                                                         | **Maintains business/research continuity** by allowing **quick restoration** of recent data.                                                     |

***

**Summary:**

* **Backups** protect against **immediate or short-term data loss** but are **not a substitute for long-term preservation**.
* **Archiving** ensures **sustainable, compliant, and cost-effective long-term storage** of inactive yet valuable research data, as expected under **UCPH policies and EU funder mandates (e.g., Horizon Europe, ERC)**.
