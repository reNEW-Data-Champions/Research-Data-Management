## **Collect and Create Stage**

During the **Collect and Create** stage, your research team actively generates, gathers, or receives data and documents. Implementing robust and standardized data management practices is critical at this point to ensure that all outputs remain organized, secure, and reusable.

A strong starting point is to **define clear directory structures and file naming conventions** as early as possible—even if your project is already underway. A well‑planned structure provides the **organizational backbone** for all datasets, analysis outputs, lab protocols, and supporting documentation, making it easier to:

1. **Locate and retrieve files quickly**, reducing time lost to disorganized storage.
2. **Maintaining consistency across team members** is essential for multi‑site or collaborative reNEW projects.
3. **Meet compliance and reporting requirements** from **UCPH, reNEW**, and **EU funders** such as **Horizon Europe**, which expect projects to follow FAIR and traceable data practices.

By establishing this organizational foundation early in the **data lifecycle**, your team ensures that every file—whether raw, processed, or finalized—is **clearly labeled, traceable to its origin, and ready for downstream analysis or sharing**.
