# Collect & Create Stage

During the Collect & Create stage, when researchers are ingesting data from external sources or generating new datasets, additional storage considerations come into play. These may include data security measures to safeguard sensitive information, data safety practices to prevent data loss or corruption, and version control systems to track changes and facilitate collaboration. Addressing these considerations early on helps ensure the research data's integrity, availability, and confidentiality throughout the project.
