### Introduction to OMERO â€“ Bioimaging Data Management at reNEW

This section introduces **OMERO**, the dedicated Bioimaging Data Management solution to be deployed at **reNEW in Winter 2025**. OMERO is an advanced, open-source platform specifically designed to manage, store, annotate, and share large-scale microscopy and bioimaging data. It supports structured, **FAIR-compliant** workflows by enabling secure, centralized storage of raw image files alongside rich metadata, annotations, and analysis results.

At reNEW, OMERO will **primarily serve as an offboarding solution** to ensure that bioimaging data produced by departing researchers remains well-organized, accessible, and reusable within the center. This approach safeguards valuable imaging datasets and supports knowledge continuity across research groups.

However, OMERO is **equally suitable for integration into active research pipelines**, offering researchers a powerful tool for managing their microscopy data throughout ongoing projects. By adopting OMERO, reNEW researchers can implement robust data management practices that support collaboration, improve reproducibility, and align with international best practices in research data stewardship.

Researchers interested in adopting OMERO for their projects or learning how it will support data management at reNEW are encouraged to contact **Richard Dennis** for further information and guidance.

> **Note:** While this section focuses specifically on OMERO, other parts of the website offer additional training materials and videos on general research data management topics. These resources include guidance on file organization, version control, FAIR data principles, and meeting funder requirements such as EU Horizon Europe Data Management Plans.
