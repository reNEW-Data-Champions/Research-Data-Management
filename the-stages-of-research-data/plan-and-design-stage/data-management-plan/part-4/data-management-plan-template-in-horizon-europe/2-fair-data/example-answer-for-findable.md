# Example answer for Findable

#### Example answer 1 (e.g., if you have not yet selected a repository)

“I aim to deposit my data set and the associated metadata in a repository that allows me to attach a digital identifier (DOI) to my data set. The repository should be set up so that the metadata I include are discoverable (indexed) by search engines such as Google. The metadata that I will  include to facilitate findability is, as a minimum: author name, data set title and keywords describing my  research topic (using as many standard terms as possible in my field), data type, and data format.”

#### Example answer 2 (e.g., if you have selected a repository)

“All research data are stored in the repository Zenodo in the community “ROMSOC H2020-MSCA-ITN”.  Zenodo allows us to describe our data with metadata (including keywords), which it registers and indexes in searchable resources. Zenodo also automatically assigns a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to every published record and version to allow globally unique and persistent identification of the data. Research data can be linked to the corresponding publications and vice versa via their DOIs.”

#### Example 3 (metadata according to a standard)

“Metadata is being modeled from "A Model Information Management System for Ecological Research, Rick C. Ingersoll, Tim R. Seastedt, and Michael Hartman, BioScience Vol. 47, No. 5 (May 1997), pp. 310-316”

For each data set, we will, as a minimum, record the following metadata:

•  Title of the data set

•  Creator

•  Location: ID, name, description, latitude, longitude

•  Climate: temperature, humidity

•  Date and time

•  Equipment used

•  Descriptive keywords covering the topic, methods

•  Variables

•  Version

Metadata will be saved in .csv format along with the data set.”
