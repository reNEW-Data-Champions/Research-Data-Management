# Data Management Plan in Horizon Europe

Beneficiaries must establish a DMP addressing essential aspects of RDM.

Beneficiaries **must submit a DMP as a deliverable** to the granting authority per the Grant  Agreement (**usually by month 6**). An **updated DMP deliverable must also be produced mid-project** (for projects longer than twelve months) **and at the end of the project** (where relevant).

**Best practice:** Beneficiaries should maintain the DMP as a living document and update it throughout the project **whenever significant changes arise**. This includes but is not limited to the generation of new data, changes in data access provisions or curation policies, attainment of tasks (e.g., datasets deposited in a  repository, etc.), changes in relevant practices (e.g., innovation potential, the decision to file for a patent),  changes in consortium composition.

**Beneficiaries are encouraged to encode their DMP deliverables as non-restricted, public deliverables** unless there are reasons (legitimate interests or other constraints) not to do so. In the case they are made public, it is also recommended that open access is provided under a CC  BY  License to allow broad re-use.

### Project Coordinators:

* Submit only one DMP for the whole project.
* Structure the DMP according to Work Packages.
* Collect detailed information from all participants.

### During the project:

* Use the DMP as guidelines for data management in your project.
* Discuss and review the DMP regularly with the project members.
* Update the DMP with new information when available.

Publish your DMP in a repository and register it in OpenAIRE.

### First draft:

* Highlight and address elements of research data management specific to your project.
* State explicitly when questions are not (yet) applicable.
* Describe and distinguish between different types of research data.
* Outline your strategy for research data management.
* Keep the principles of Open Science (including research integrity) in mind.
* Refer to traditions and best practices (in your field), where possible.
* Indicate and explain any exemptions from public open access to your research data.
