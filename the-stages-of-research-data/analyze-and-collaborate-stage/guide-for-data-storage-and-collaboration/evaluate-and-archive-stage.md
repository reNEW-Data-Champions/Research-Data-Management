# Evaluate & Archive Stage

Researchers must develop strategies to evaluate and archive their data upon project completion. This involves determining where data should be stored, whether on-site or in cloud-based repositories, what data should be preserved long-term, and how data can be shared with other researchers to promote transparency and reproducibility. Decisions made at this stage can have long-lasting implications for the availability and utility of research data, underscoring the importance of thoughtful, comprehensive data storage management throughout the research lifecycle.
