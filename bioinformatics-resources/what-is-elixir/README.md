## **RDM Support Resources: ELIXIR RDMkit**

The **ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit)** is a comprehensive, community-driven resource designed to support life science researchers in managing their data responsibly, effectively, and in accordance with the **FAIR principles**â€”making data **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable**.

RDMkit provides stage-by-stage guidance across the entire research data lifecycle and is built by and for the life science research community. It includes best practices, policy alignment, tool recommendations, and practical case studies tailored for experimental and computational biology.

## **Why RDMkit Matters for reNEW**

At **reNEW**, our research is highly interdisciplinary, encompassing molecular biology, genomics, imaging, and stem cell research. These fields produce complex, high-volume datasets that require structured data workflows, metadata standards, and sustainable storage practices. The **RDMkit is relevant to these challenges** and offers scalable guidance that aligns with reNEWâ€™s commitment to responsible and transparent research.

Both **early-career researchers** and **senior investigators** at reNEW are encouraged to consult the RDMkit when:

* Writing or updating **Data Management Plans (DMPs)** for grant applications
* Setting up **data collection workflows** or managing sensitive datasets
* Preparing for **data publication or deposition** in public repositories
* Implementing the **FAIR principles** in daily research workflows

## **For reNEW Data Champions**

The RDMkit is also an essential tool for **reNEW Data Champions**, who serve as peer-level advisors and role models for good data management. It supports them in:

* Guiding colleagues in adopting domain-specific standards
* Advising on interoperable data formats and documentation
* Promoting reproducibility and long-term data value

## **Recommended by Funders**

The RDMkit is explicitly referenced in the **Horizon Europe Programme Guide** as a trusted source of data management best practices for life science researchers. Using it strengthens reNEWâ€™s alignment with funder expectations and institutional policies at UCPH.
