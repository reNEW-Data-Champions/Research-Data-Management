# Findability

Findability is about making digital resources easily discoverable and locatable. The following are key aspects to consider:

* F1. Assign globally unique and persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs or ORCIDs) to data and metadata so they can be consistently referenced and located.
* F2. Use rich metadata, including standard descriptive information and keywords, to describe the data and its context to facilitate discovery through search engines and repositories.
* F3. Register the metadata in a searchable resource, such as a data catalog, database, or registry, to make it discoverable by others.
* F4. Include clear and comprehensive information about the data provenance, such as the origin, history, and any changes made to the data.
