## **Onboarding at reNEW: Engaging with Your Data Champion**

As part of your onboarding at reNEW, meeting with your designated Data Champion is essential to ensure you are fully supported in managing your research data effectively. The Data Champions Program at reNEW is designed to provide hands-on expertise and personalized guidance on best practices in Research Data Management (RDM). By consulting with your Data Champion early, you can receive tailored advice on organizing, storing, and documenting your data in line with institutional policies and the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

Good research data management is fundamental to the success of any project. It enhances your research's integrity, reproducibility, and impact and ensures compliance with funder and publisher mandates. Organizing your data from the outset will save time, reduce errors, and facilitate collaboration with colleagues within and outside of reNEW. Your Data Champion will help you establish a robust data management plan, adopt consistent file naming and documentation practices, and ensure your data is stored securely for long-term access and reuse.

By leveraging the expertise of the Data Champions, you position yourself to efficiently navigate the complexities of RDM and optimize the quality and impact of your research throughout its lifecycle.
