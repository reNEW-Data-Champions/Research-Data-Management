# Research Open Data Management Matrix

Research Open Data Management Matrix (RODMM) is an integrated approach to managing research data throughout its lifecycle, emphasizing the interconnectedness of various aspects such as data collection, storage, sharing, preservation, and analysis. In alignment with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and Open Science practices, RODMM prioritizes collaboration and communication among researchers, data managers, and other stakeholders to ensure that data is well-organized, accessible, and reusable. By considering data management's technical, ethical, legal, and organizational aspects, RODMM promotes efficient, transparent, and reproducible research outcomes while addressing data security, privacy, and compliance with relevant standards and regulations. This comprehensive approach fosters a culture of openness and knowledge sharing, ultimately benefiting the global research community and accelerating scientific discovery.
