### &#x20;and is**Leveraging Machine-Actionable DMPs for Enhanced Research Workflows**

**Disclaimer**\
The views expressed here are my own in my professional capacity as a Data Steward and Research Data Manager. They do not necessarily represent the official positions of the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Medicine â€“ reNEW.

## **Introduction**

Data Management Plans (DMPs) are a cornerstone of good research practice. They guide how data will be collected, stored, shared, and preserved throughout the research lifecycle. Traditionally, DMPs have been static documentsâ€”useful at the planning stage but rarely integrated into the day-to-day workflow.

Today, research environments are increasingly complex, interconnected, and data-driven. To meet these demands, we need to move beyond static text documents toward **machine-actionable Data Management Plans (maDMPs)**â€”dynamic, interoperable tools that integrate seamlessly into research systems and workflows.

## **Key Challenges with Traditional DMPs**

* **Static Format** â€“ Cannot adapt easily to evolving project needs.
* **Manual Processes** â€“ Require repeated data entry across multiple systems.
* **Limited Integration** â€“ Information is locked in PDFs or Word documents, not reusable by machines.
* **Compliance Burden** â€“ Updating and reporting require manual effort, risking errors and omissions.

## **Best Practices and Solutions: Moving to maDMPs**

**Efficiency**

* Automate information exchange between systems (e.g., repositories, funding portals).
* Reduce administrative work through auto-population of metadata fields.

**Accuracy**

* Machine-readable formats eliminate repetitive manual entry and reduce human error.

**Interoperability**

* Integrate with research infrastructure such as Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS), repositories, and publication platforms.

**Compliance**

* Automatically track alignment with funder, institutional, and legal requirements.
* Enable real-time updates and reporting without rewriting the DMP from scratch.

## **Local Context: reNEW and UCPH**

At reNEW and across the University of Copenhagen, DMPs are required or strongly encouraged for funded projects. Current practice often involves text-based templates, which can be limiting for collaborative, data-intensive research.

Implementing **machine-actionable DMPs** could:

* Improve alignment between project planning, UCPH-approved storage systems, and FAIR data principles.
* Support compliance with Horizon Europe, ERC, and Danish funder mandates through automated reporting.
* Enhance collaboration between UCPH research groups and international partners by enabling system-to-system DMP sharing.

## **Practical Recommendations**

1. **Adopt maDMP Tools** â€“ Use platforms like the Research Data Allianceâ€™s maDMP specifications or DMPonline with machine-actionable export formats.
2. **Integrate with Existing Systems** â€“ Connect DMP tools with institutional repositories, ERDA storage, and publication workflows.
3. **Automate Metadata Population** â€“ Allow DMP fields to feed dataset registration and DOI requests directly feed dataset registration and DOI requests.
4. **Embed Compliance Checks** â€“ Configure maDMPs to flag non-compliance before reporting deadlines.
5. **Promote Collaborative Access** â€“ Ensure collaborators can view and update maDMPs in real time.

## **Looking Ahead**

Machine-actionable DMPs are more than an administrative upgradeâ€”they are a strategic enabler of reproducible, efficient, and collaborative science. By adopting maDMPs, reNEW researchers can reduce manual burden, increase compliance confidence, and focus more on discovery.
