## **Biomedical Research Infrastructure and the Imperative for Robust Research Data Management**

**Disclaimer**\
The views expressed here are my own in my professional capacity as a Data Steward and Research Data Manager at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Medicine â€“ reNEW, University of Copenhagen. They do not necessarily represent the official views of reNEW Copenhagen or the UCPH Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences.

## **Introduction**

Biomedical research is evolving in a profoundly data-intensive environment. Advances in **genomics, high-resolution imaging, single-cell analysis, and computational biology** have transformed the fieldâ€”producing unprecedented data volumes and complexity.

Harnessing this data for discovery depends on the infrastructure and practices used to manage, store, share, and preserve it. **Research Data Management (RDM)** is central to this effort, ensuring that biomedical data remains **reliable, accessible, secure, and reusable** throughout its lifecycle.

Robust RDM is not just a technical necessity; it is also a cornerstone of research integrity, efficiency, and long-term impact.

## **Key Challenges in Biomedical RDM**

**1. Data Volume and Complexity**

* Biomedical datasets often span terabytes to petabytes, from genome sequences to time-lapse imaging.
* Without standardization and documentation, these datasets risk becoming fragmented or unusable.\
  **Approaches:**
  * Use standardized metadata schemas and formats.
  * Implement automated quality control and curation tools.
  * Create DMPs at the start of every project to guide workflows.

**2. Interoperability Gaps**

* Disparate systems and formats hinder data sharing and reuse across projects and institutions.\
  **Approaches:**
  * Adopt community or domain-specific data standards.
  * Participate in harmonization initiatives such as GA4GH and ELIXIR.
  * Design infrastructure with interoperability as a core principle.

**3. Data Security and Privacy**

* Many biomedical datasets contain sensitive personal or clinical information.\
  **Approaches:**
  * Apply encryption, fine-grained access controls, and secure authentication.
  * Use anonymization or pseudonymization techniques where appropriate.
  * Ensure compliance with GDPR and other applicable regulations.

**4. Infrastructure and Funding Limitations**

* Investment in hardware, software, and skilled personnel is essential but often underfunded.\
  **Approaches:**
  * Advocate for RDM support in funding proposals.
  * Leverage institutional and national infrastructure platforms.
  * Ensure equitable access to infrastructure across research groups.

## **Local Context: reNEW and UCPH**

At reNEW Copenhagen and the University of Copenhagen, biomedical research increasingly depends on large-scale imaging, sequencing, and multi-omics datasets. Key needs include:

* **Scalable, secure storage** integrated with UCPH-approved platforms such as ERDA.
* **Interoperable data pipelines** to enable collaboration across reNEWâ€™s partner institutions.
* **Training and support** for researchers to implement FAIR and compliant data management from project start.

## **Practical Recommendations**

1. **Integrate RDM Early** â€“ Include RDM planning at the grant application stage.
2. **Adopt Standards** â€“ Use domain-relevant metadata and file formats.
3. **Ensure Security by Design** â€“ Build privacy and security measures into infrastructure from the outset.
4. **Leverage Institutional Resources** â€“ Utilize UCPH and Danish national data services for storage, curation, and sharing.
5. **Foster a Data Stewardship Culture** â€“ Provide training and recognition for good RDM practices.

## **Looking Ahead**

The future of biomedical research depends on **data that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable**. By investing in robust RDM infrastructure and cultivating a culture of responsible data stewardship, we can maximize the scientific, ethical, and societal value of biomedical research.
