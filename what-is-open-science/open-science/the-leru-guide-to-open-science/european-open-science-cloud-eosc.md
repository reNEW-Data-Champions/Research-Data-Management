# European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)

The EOSC is a European initiative to provide a virtual environment where researchers can store, manage, analyze, and share research data across disciplines and borders. By offering a shared infrastructure, resources, and services, the EOSC aims to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, data reuse, and the development of new data-driven research methods. Institutions should actively participate in the EOSC, contribute to its governance, and promote its use among their researchers.
