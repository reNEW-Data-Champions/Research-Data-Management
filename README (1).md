## üß¨ reNEW Research Data Management (RDM) Hub

**Your central platform for biomedical research data guidance, tools, and support at reNEW, BMI, and UCPH.**

Whether a new researcher or a senior scientist, this hub helps you navigate the full research data lifecycle, including UCPH policies, funder mandates, and FAIR-aligned best practices. All content is tailored to the biomedical domain and links to relevant UCPH guidelines whenever possible.

***

## üéì Getting Started at reNEW

If you're newly employed at reNEW, it's essential to embed good RDM practices from the start. This platform offers a structured onboarding path covering:

* UCPH research data policies
* EU and funder-specific requirements
* Best practices for managing and sharing biomedical data
* Adoption of the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)

**Start by reviewing these two introductory presentations:**

* **Promoting Good Research Data Management through the Use of Data Champions**\
  An overview of reNEW‚Äôs peer-led support system promoting reproducibility, compliance, and responsible data stewardship.
* **Data Management Plan (DMP) Seminar**\
  This is a short introduction to DMPs, what they are, why they matter, and how to meet UCPH and funder expectations.

These materials will help you establish good practices from day one and connect with your local RDM support network.
