# ðŸŸ¡ Getting Started

## Getting Started

This section serves as a comprehensive onboarding and support hub for Research Data Management (RDM) at reNEW, University of Copenhagen. It empowers new and experienced researchers to navigate institutional requirements, policies, and best practices confidently. The site is organized into clearly defined sections, offering a structured path to mastering RDMâ€”from foundational concepts to specialized workflowsâ€”ensuring clarity and ease of use at every stage.

Importantly, curated biomedical resources specific to reNEWâ€”such as sequencing templates, platform guides, and research group portalsâ€”are included to support your domain-specific work. These resources are complemented by the UCPH Research Portal, which remains the official institutional gateway for RDM tools, policies, and infrastructure, ensuring that you always reference trusted and authoritative information.

If you need personalized assistance with developing your DMP or any aspect of research data management, don't hesitate to contact <mark style="color:red;">**Richard Dennis**</mark>. On-site consultations are available every Wednesday from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM or by appointment.\
