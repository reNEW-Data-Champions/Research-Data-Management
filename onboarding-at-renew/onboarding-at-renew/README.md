# ðŸŸ  Onboarding at reNEW

## **Welcome to reNEW: Research Data Management Onboarding.**

## <mark style="color:$danger;">**Onboarding PowerPoint Slides for Below**</mark>

Welcome to the **reNEW Research Data Management (RDM) Platform** â€” your central hub for tools, guidance, and support throughout the research data lifecycle. Whether you're a new researcher just getting started or a senior scientist refining your workflows, this platform is designed to help you confidently navigate institutional policies, funder requirements, and best practices in responsible data management.

***

## **Getting Started as a New Researcher at reNEW**

As a newly employed researcher at reNEW, it is essential to engage with RDM practices from the beginning of your project. This platform provides a structured onboarding path, guiding you through the core components of responsible data management, including:

* UCPH research data policies
* Funder-specific requirements
* Best practices for handling and sharing research data
* Adoption of the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)

To support your onboarding, please begin by reviewing the following two introductory presentations:

* **Promoting Good Research Data Management through the Use of Data Champions**\
  An overview of reNEWâ€™s peer-led support system that promotes reproducibility, compliance, and a shared culture of responsible data stewardship.
* **Data Management Plan (DMP) Seminar**\
  A short introduction to DMPs, explaining their purpose and how to develop one that meets both UCPH and funder expectations.

These materials will help you establish good practices from day one and connect you with the local RDM support network.

***

## **What Youâ€™ll Find on This Platform**

The reNEW RDM Platform is structured to offer a comprehensive, easy-to-navigate experience, including:

* **Onboarding resources** for new researchers
* **Institutional policies** and **funder guidelines**
* **Practical guidance** across all phases of the research lifecycle
* **Templates and documentation** for domain-specific research (e.g., sequencing data, imaging platforms)
* **Links to group-specific data portals** and internal workflows
* **Direct access** to the UCPH Research Portal â€” the official source for RDM tools, services, and compliance documentation

***

## **reNEW Data Champions Program**

The **reNEW Data Champions** are volunteer researchers trained to provide peer-to-peer RDM support. Their role is to help foster a collaborative, practical, and FAIR-aligned approach to data stewardship within the reNEW community.

#### The Data Champions support you by:

* Helping organize, store, and share data effectively
* Promoting compliance with legal, institutional, and funder mandates
* Supporting the adoption and implementation of the FAIR principles
* Guiding the integration of RDM best practices into your workflows

By embedding these principles into everyday research, the Data Champions contribute to a stronger, more sustainable data culture across the Node.

***

## **Building a Responsible Data Culture**

Responsible data management is a shared responsibility. Through collaborative support and clear standards, reNEW aims to:

* Enhance the reproducibility and integrity of scientific outputs
* Encourage open, responsible data sharing
* Ensure long-term preservation, accessibility, and reuse of research data
* Align with institutional and funder expectations for transparency and data governance
