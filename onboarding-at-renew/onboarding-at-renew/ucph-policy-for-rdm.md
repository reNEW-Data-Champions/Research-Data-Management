# üü† UCPH Policy for RDM

Below is a detailed summary of the **University of Copenhagen (UCPH) Policy for Research Data Management (2022)**, focusing primarily on data management and storage requirements. I also highlight key roles, responsibilities, and caveats you should watch out for. (You can refer directly to the policy PDF for full wording.) ([research.ku.dk](https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

***

### Overview & Scope

* The policy covers **all research data** (physical and digital) collected, generated, reused, or observed **from 11 January 2022 onward** in research at UCPH. ([research.ku.dk](https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* It applies not only to scientific staff and PhD candidates, but also to visiting/affiliate researchers, research support staff (e.g., lab technicians or data managers), and students when they produce or contribute to research data. ([research.ku.dk](https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* The policy is intended to ensure **good scientific practice**, **research integrity**, and **compliance with legal and ethical obligations** (e.g., GDPR, intellectual property, confidentiality).

### Key Policy Requirements for Data Management & Storage (Sections 2.5 ‚ÄúStorage and Security‚Äù and related)

Below are the main obligations regarding data storage, infrastructure, classification, security, and retention under the UCPH policy.

<table><thead><tr><th width="541">Requirement</th><th>Description / Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Data Classification &#x26; Risk Assessment</strong></td><td>At the start of a research project, researchers must classify data by sensitivity (e.g. personal data, confidential, open) and assess risks in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. (<a href="https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">research.ku.dk</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Infrastructure Choices</strong></td><td>Storage and processing infrastructure must be chosen <strong>in alignment with the assessed risks</strong> and <strong>in compliance</strong> with UCPH‚Äôs Information Security Policy and applicable data protection laws. (<a href="https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">research.ku.dk</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Access Control</strong></td><td>Physical and digital access to data must be controlled. Only authorized persons should have access, based on roles defined in the project. (<a href="https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">research.ku.dk</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Backup &#x26; Redundancy</strong></td><td>The policy demands appropriate backup procedures to guard against data loss. Backup frequency, locations, and procedures should be aligned with the classification of data and risk assessments. (<a href="https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">research.ku.dk</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Threat Assessment (Internal &#x26; External)</strong></td><td>Researchers must consider internal/external threats (e.g., malicious actors, system failures) to confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility, and mitigate those risks. (<a href="https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">research.ku.dk</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Personal Data Protections &#x26; DPIA</strong></td><td>For projects involving personal or sensitive personal data, a <strong>risk assessment for data subjects‚Äô rights/freedoms</strong> must be made. In high-risk cases, a <strong>Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)</strong> may be required. (<a href="https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">research.ku.dk</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Retention / Preservation / Destruction</strong></td><td>The policy requires a plan for <strong>long-term preservation or destruction</strong> of research data. It must include periodic review, and consideration of cost, legal obligations, or feasibility. (<a href="https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">research.ku.dk</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Copy at UCPH after Project Ends</strong></td><td>A copy of data sets and associated metadata must remain at UCPH after project completion (or when an employee leaves) in a format that ensures accessibility. (<a href="https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">research.ku.dk</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Open Sharing / ‚ÄúAs Open as Possible, As Closed as Necessary‚Äù</strong></td><td>By default, data underlying publications should be made openly available, unless prevented by legal, ethical, confidentiality, or commercial constraints. (<a href="https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">research.ku.dk</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Agreements &#x26; Legal Compliance</strong></td><td>Where data are shared with external collaborators, proper agreements (e.g. data transfer, confidentiality) must be in place. Legal, ethical, and contractual obligations must be respected. (<a href="https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">research.ku.dk</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Metadata &#x26; Documentation</strong></td><td>Adequate metadata must be created and preserved alongside the data so that the data can be found, understood, and reused. (<a href="https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">research.ku.dk</a>)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Updates to Data Management Plans (DMPs)</strong></td><td>If significant changes occur in how data are handled during the project, the DMP must be updated. The DMP must be stored together with the research data. (<a href="https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">research.ku.dk</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Additional Considerations & Constraints

* The policy references alignment with the **Information Security Policy** of UCPH, meaning storage and processing must also satisfy UCPH‚Äôs general security, confidentiality, and integrity frameworks. ([research.ku.dk](https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Compliance with GDPR and Danish data protection law is mandatory when personal data is involved. The policy explicitly requires recording legal/ethical approvals and the research data. ([research.ku.dk](https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* The policy does not explicitly mandate a specific storage technology (cloud vs local vs hybrid); instead, it requires that the chosen infrastructure matches the assessed risk. ([research.ku.dk](https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Faculties, departments, or research groups may adopt **additional local guidelines or stricter rules** tailored to their discipline or data types. ([research.ku.dk](https://research.ku.dk/integrity/documents/UCPH_Policy_for_Research_Data_Management_2022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
