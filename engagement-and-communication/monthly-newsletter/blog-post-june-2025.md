## **Research Data Management at Universities: Storage Solutions**

**Disclaimer**\
The views expressed here are my own in my professional capacity as a Data Steward and Research Data Manager. They do not necessarily reflect the official opinions or positions of the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Medicine ‚Äì reNEW.

## **Introduction**

Universities are at the forefront of generating vast and complex research data, from social science surveys to high-resolution imaging and genomic sequencing in biomedical research.

Effective **Research Data Management (RDM)** is critical to:

* Ensure accuracy and reproducibility of results
* Maintain the security and integrity of research data
* Enable accessibility and long-term preservation
* Meet institutional, legal, and funding compliance requirements

As research projects scale in size, interdisciplinarity, and technical complexity, universities face growing challenges in delivering sustainable, equitable, and technically robust **storage solutions** for their researchers.

## **The Unique Challenges of University Research Data**

Universities must meet the diverse needs of multiple research domains ‚Äî each with its own data volume, format, and lifespan requirements. Key challenges include:

1. **Multidisciplinary Demands**‚ÄîStorage systems must accommodate a wide range of data types, from large imaging datasets to small textual datasets.
2. **Variable Data Lifespans**‚ÄîSome data are short-lived, while others (e.g., longitudinal studies) must be retained for decades.
3. **Collaborative Workflows** ‚Äì Cross-department, cross-institution, and international collaborations require secure, reliable, and accessible sharing.
4. **Compliance and Ethics** ‚Äì Sensitive data (e.g., human subjects research) must comply with strict legal and ethical standards.

## **Common Storage Solutions in RDM**

To address these challenges, universities typically combine different storage strategies:

* **On-Premise Storage Systems** ‚Äì High-speed, institution-managed data centers for analysis-intensive workflows.
* **Cloud Storage** ‚Äì Scalable, flexible, and collaboration-friendly solutions like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure.
* **Hybrid Models** ‚Äì Combining on-premise and cloud storage to balance performance, security, and scalability.
* **Data Repositories** ‚Äì Institutional or domain-specific repositories for long-term preservation, discoverability, and FAIR compliance.
* **Secure Storage for Sensitive Data** ‚Äì Encryption, fine-grained access control, and auditing for clinical or personal datasets.
* **Data Archiving** ‚Äì Cost-efficient long-term storage for infrequently accessed but valuable datasets.

## **Local Focus: UCPH IT Storage Costs**

A recent policy change at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) now charges research groups directly for storage. Currently:

* Only **‚Äúactive‚Äù storage tiers** are available ‚Äî there is no true **Tier 3 cold storage** for archival needs.
* Costs are applied equally, regardless of how often data is accessed.

**Concerns:**

* **Cost Equity** ‚Äì Groups with large archival datasets face disproportionately high recurring costs, creating inequities between well-funded and underfunded projects.
* **No Low-Cost Archival Option** ‚Äì Data that could be archived is forced into higher-cost active storage tiers.
* **Risk to Data Preservation** ‚Äì Without affordable archival storage, researchers may delete datasets prematurely, undermining reproducibility and long-term value.

## **Recommendations for Sustainable University Storage**

For UCPH and other universities facing similar challenges, a sustainable and equitable RDM storage strategy should:

1. **Introduce Tiered Storage Models**, including a low-cost Tier 3 cold storage for rarely accessed data.
2. **Align Pricing with Use** ‚Äì Costs should reflect access frequency and storage volume to avoid penalizing long-term preservation.
3. **Invest in Institutional Infrastructure** ‚Äì Ensure scalable, secure, and researcher-friendly storage options that meet FAIR and Open Science requirements.
4. **Support Archival-Quality Data Management** ‚Äì Reduce the risk of valuable datasets being lost due to budget constraints.

**Final Note**\
As research data volumes grow, the need for well-planned, sustainable storage solutions is more pressing than ever. Institutions prioritizing equitable, cost-effective, and compliant storage will be better positioned to support groundbreaking research and uphold Open Science commitments.
