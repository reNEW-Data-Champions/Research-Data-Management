## **Reproducibility and Open Science**

**Disclaimer**\
The views expressed here are my own in my professional capacity as a Data Steward and Research Data Manager. They do not necessarily represent the official positions of the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Medicine â€“ reNEW.

## **Introduction**

At the core of credible science lies a simple principle: **results must be reproducible**. If a study cannot be repeated with the same outcomes, its findings remain uncertain, no matter how promising they appear.

Reproducibility is not only a technical standard but the foundation of trust between researchers and the public. In recent years, the **Open Science** movement has emerged as a powerful driver of reproducibility, promoting transparency, collaboration, and accessibility across the research landscape.

## **Key Challenges in Reproducibility**

**1. Erosion of Trust**

* A significant number of published studies cannot be replicated, raising concerns about the reliability of the scientific record.

**2. Wasted Resources**

* Pursuing irreproducible research consumes time, funding, and effort that could be directed toward more reliable work.

**3. High-Stakes Consequences**

* In fields like medicine and public health, irreproducible results can have direct impacts on patient care and policy decisions.

## **Best Practices and Solutions: Open Science in Action**

**Open Access**

* Removes paywalls, broadening the reach of published research.
* Expands peer review opportunities beyond traditional reviewers.
* Facilitates early detection of errors through wider scrutiny.

**Open Data**

* Makes raw data available for verification, re-analysis, and reuse.
* Supports meta-analyses and cross-study comparisons.
* Strengthens the robustness and generalizability of conclusions.

**Open Methodology**

* Shares detailed protocols and workflows to enable replication.
* Promotes standardization, reducing variability between studies.
* Encourages feedback that improves experimental design.

**Open Source**

* Publishes code and algorithms for community inspection and improvement.
* Reduces the risk of hidden errors in proprietary tools.
* Enables reproducible and transparent computational analysis.

## **Local Context: reNEW and UCPH**

At reNEW Copenhagen and the University of Copenhagen, adopting Open Science principles can significantly enhance reproducibility across research domains. This means:

* Making datasets and metadata available in UCPH-approved repositories.
* Documenting and sharing methods and protocols in accessible formats.
* Using open-source analytical tools to enable verifiable results.
* Encouraging cross-group and interdisciplinary collaboration to validate findings.

## **Practical Recommendations**

1. **Publish in Open Access Journals** â€“ Maximize reach and transparency.
2. **Deposit Data in Trusted Repositories** â€“ Ensure accessibility and FAIR compliance.
3. **Share Detailed Protocols** â€“ Use platforms like protocols.io to make methods reusable.
4. **Use and Contribute to Open-Source Tools** â€“ Promote transparency in computational workflows.
5. **Embed Openness in Project Planning** â€“ Address reproducibility in DMPs from the outset.

## **Looking Ahead**

Reproducibility and Open Science are not optional extras but **pillars of high-quality, credible research**. By committing to openness, we strengthen trust in science, foster collaboration, and build a more transparent and equitable global research ecosystem.
