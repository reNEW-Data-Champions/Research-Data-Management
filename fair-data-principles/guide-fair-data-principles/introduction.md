# Introduction

The FAIR Principles represent a unified set of guidelines to optimize the discoverability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of scientific data, research outputs, and digital resources, such as software. The acronym "FAIR" stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Established in 2016, these principles provide an essential framework for researchers, data stewards, and repositories, facilitating data-driven research and fostering efficient data integration across diverse disciplines and domains. By adhering to the FAIR Principles, the value and potential of data can be maximized, ensuring its responsible and prudent use while promoting collaboration and innovation within the scientific community.
