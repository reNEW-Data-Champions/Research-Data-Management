# ðŸŸ¤ Data Storage

## **Data Storage, Collaboration, and HPC Resources at UCPH** <a href="#qkgro3bbmczl" id="qkgro3bbmczl"></a>

## **Introduction** <a href="#qqgtgcfy7mzs" id="qqgtgcfy7mzs"></a>

Biomedical research at **reNEW â€“ The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Medicine, UCPH,** is data-intensive, often involving large imaging datasets, sensitive patient information, and complex analyses. Effective **Research Data Management (RDM)** ensures data security, meets legal and ethical obligations (including GDPR compliance), and supports high-quality, reproducible science.

A critical component of RDM is **data storage management** throughout the **Research Data Lifecycle**. Each stageâ€”from planning to archivingâ€”requires careful consideration of storage infrastructure, data privacy, security protocols, and collaboration needs, especially in projects that involve personal data or multi-institutional teams.

This guide provides an overview of best practices and the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) facilities supporting data storage, sharing, and high-performance computing (HPC) tailored to the needs of biomedical researchers at reNEW.
