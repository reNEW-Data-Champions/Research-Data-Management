# Research Data Management

## üî¨ **Data Champions Research Data Management Hub**

Welcome to the central hub for Research Data Management (RDM) at reNEW and the Department of Biomedical Sciences. This space combines key resources, practical guidance, and technical support for managing research data across its entire lifecycle. Whether you're a PhD student, technician, postdoc, or group leader, this hub is designed to help you navigate RDM requirements confidently and efficiently.

***

### üìÅ Research Data Management (RDM)

This section introduces the core principles and practices of research data management. It explains RDM, why it matters, and how it fits into your daily research activities. You will find:

* Guidance on writing and updating Data Management Plans (DMPs)
* An overview of the research data lifecycle
* Requirements from funders, institutions, and publishers
* Examples of good RDM practices from biomedical and life science domains
* Practical templates and checklists for project planning and documentation

***

### üîê Data Protection and GDPR

Here, you‚Äôll find resources focused on handling personal, sensitive, or confidential data. This section outlines how to manage such data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and institutional policies. Topics include:

* What constitutes personal and sensitive data in research
* When and how to obtain informed consent
* The difference between anonymization and pseudonymization
* How to work with Data Processor Agreements (DPAs)
* Secure data storage and access controls
* Ethical approval procedures

***

### üéì eLearning Videos and Tutorials

This section offers on-demand learning materials to help you build your knowledge of research data management and Open Science. It includes:

* Short video tutorials on DMP writing, FAIR principles, and metadata
* Walkthroughs for using tools like ARGOS, Git, and ERDA
* Recorded webinars and training sessions from internal and external experts
* Researcher-friendly explanations of legal and ethical considerations in RDM

These materials are ideal for onboarding, self-paced learning, or refresher training.

***

### üåê FAIR and Open Science Resources

Here you‚Äôll find resources to help you align your research practices with the principles of Open Science and the FAIR framework‚Äîensuring your data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. This section includes:

* Introductions to the FAIR principles
* Best practices for data sharing and reuse
* Standard licensing options and what they mean for data openness
* Guidance on persistent identifiers (DOIs, ORCID, ROR, etc.)
* Lists of trusted repositories across domains

***

### üîÑ FAIR Workflow Resources

This section supports researchers who are implementing FAIR workflows in practice. It focuses on automating and structuring data management within your lab‚Äôs workflow and includes:

* Metadata templates tailored for bioimaging, genomics, and other life science domains
* Strategies for integrating electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) and imaging databases
* Guidance on version control and provenance tracking
* Tools for linking datasets to publications and persistent identifiers
* Recommendations for embedding standards and ontologies into your data

This is especially useful for high-impact, open, and reproducible research projects.

***

### üß∞ IT Support and Infrastructure

This section provides an overview of the technical infrastructure available at reNEW and UCPH to support research data workflows. It outlines:

* Available secure storage systems (Personal Drive, Shared Drive, S-Drive, SIF, ERDA)
* Computing and analysis platforms (UCloud, Computerome, LUMI, and others)
* Collaboration and sharing tools (e.g., OneDrive, Teams, SharePoint)
* Data transfer tools for large-scale imaging and omics files
* Where and how to request IT support for RDM needs

The goal is to ensure you know what resources are available and how to request assistance.

***

### üìò RDM Guides, Templates, and Checklists

This is the documentation-rich section of the hub. It combines comprehensive guides, templates, and checklists to help you plan, manage, document, and share your data effectively. You will find:

* RDM policy summaries and quick-reference guides
* DMP templates for major funders
* Checklists for data collection, storage, publication, and project exit
* Metadata documentation guides specific to imaging and genomics
* Sample data organization plans and folder structures

These documents are curated to save time, improve compliance, and support reproducibility.
