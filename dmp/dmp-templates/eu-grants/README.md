# ðŸŸ¢ EU Grant Templates

## EU Grant Templates

The section on EU Grant templates offers tailored Data Management Plan (DMP) resources for projects funded under ERC, Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Actions, Horizon Europe, and Horizon 2020. Each template is structured to reflect the specific requirements outlined by the European Commission, including detailed planning for data collection, documentation, sharing, preservation, and open access obligations. Providing a clear framework aligned with funder expectations, these templates help researchers systematically address compliance while supporting transparency, reproducibility, and effective data stewardship in EU-funded research projects.
