# ðŸ”´ What is a DMP?

### **BMI reNEW â€“ Data Management Support**

I appreciate your interest in research data management at BMI reNEW. As imaging-heavy biomedical research generates vast, complex datasets, it is vital to plan carefully how you manage, store, and share this data.

A **Data Management Plan (DMP)** is a formal document that helps you structure your data workflow from start to finish. It ensures compliance with institutional, funding, and legal requirements, essential for open science and FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

### **Why create a DMP?**

* Organizes your data management tasks.
* Meets funder and institutional requirements.
* Supports FAIR data sharing and reuse.
* Reduces risks of data loss or misuse.
* Facilitates collaboration and transparency.

### **Key Components of a DMP:**

* **Data Description:** What data (e.g., images) will be collected, in which formats, and volumes.
* **Collection & Processing:** Methods, tools, and software used.
* **Metadata & Documentation:** Standards to describe data so others can understand and use it.
* **Storage & Backup:** Secure storage locations and backup strategies.
* **Ethics & Legal Compliance:** GDPR and ethical safeguards for sensitive data.
* **Sharing & Access:** How and when data will be shared, using repositories like Zenodo or Dataverse.
* **Long-Term Preservation:** Ensuring data remains accessible over time.
* **Roles & Responsibilities:** Assigning clear management responsibilities.
* **Budget & Resources:** Estimating storage, software, and staff time costs.

### **Tools to help you:**

* **DMPonline** (Europe)
* **DMPTool** (US)
