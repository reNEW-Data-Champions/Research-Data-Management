# EOSC - European Open Science Cloud





{% hint style="info" %}
The **European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)** is an initiative by the European Commission aimed at developing a federated, open, and seamless infrastructure for research data and services across Europe. EOSC aims to provide European researchers and scientists with access to a shared virtual environment where they can store, manage, analyze, and reuse data from various scientific disciplines. This infrastructure is designed to facilitate the adoption of **Open Science practices**, promote **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data), and foster collaboration among researchers across Europe.

Key objectives of EOSC include:

1. **Data Sharing and Reuse**: Encouraging researchers to share their data, making it accessible and reusable within and across disciplines.
2. **Federated Infrastructure**: Connecting existing data infrastructures, repositories, and services from across Europe into a single, user-friendly platform.
3. **Interoperability and Standards**: Promoting common standards to ensure data and services are compatible and interoperable across various scientific domains.
4. **Open Science Culture**: Supporting and incentivizing a shift towards openness and transparency in scientific research, including open access to publications, data, and collaboration.

EOSC serves as a **digital ecosystem** to improve the accessibility, management, and long-term sustainability of research data, tools, and services, aiming to enhance European scientific discovery and innovation.
