#### Notes & Recommendations

* Since cost/pricing and full SLA information is **not** publicly specified for many of these services, I recommend reaching out directly to the HPC Centre’s support team (via ERDA or SIF email contacts) to request:
  * Current pricing schedule (if any) for your project, especially for customised HPC setups.
  * Formal SLA or service commitment document (uptime, support response times, data retention guarantees).
