# ðŸŸ£ Serup Group

## [Group research](https://renew.ku.dk/research/reseach-groups/serup-group/#collapse-1582021919959)

The group is particularly interested in understanding how Notch signaling regulates several distinct processes during pancreatic development. Most of their studies involve chicken, mice, and embryonic stem cells. They use various techniques, including gene targeting, transgenic mice, gene arrays, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, tissue explants, and in ovo electroporation. All these experiments aim to understand the genetic and cellular interactions that direct pancreatic.
