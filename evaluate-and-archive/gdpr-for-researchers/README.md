# ⚪ GDPR for Researchers

## **GDPR for Researchers**

Handling personal or sensitive data requires more than technical skills—it requires legal awareness. This section guides you through GDPR foundations, including institutional policies, the Data Protection Agency links, and practical project-based case studies (“GDPR in projects like mine”). You’ll come away with a clear understanding of consent forms, anonymization techniques, data retention policies, and documentation standards to keep your research ethically sound and legally compliant.
