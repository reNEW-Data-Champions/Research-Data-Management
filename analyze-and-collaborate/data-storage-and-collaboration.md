### **Introduction** <a href="#qqgtgcfy7mzs" id="qqgtgcfy7mzs"></a>

Biomedical research at **reNEW â€“ The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Medicine, UCPH,** is data-intensive, often involving large imaging datasets, sensitive patient information, and complex analyses. Effective **Research Data Management (RDM)** ensures data security, meets legal and ethical obligations (including GDPR compliance), and supports high-quality, reproducible science.

A critical component of RDM is **data storage management** throughout the **Research Data Lifecycle**. Each stageâ€”from planning to archivingâ€”requires careful consideration of storage infrastructure, data privacy, security protocols, and collaboration needs, especially in projects that involve personal data or multi-institutional teams.

This guide provides an overview of best practices and the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) facilities supporting data storage, sharing, and high-performance computing (HPC) tailored to the needs of biomedical researchers at reNEW.

## **The Research Data Lifecycle and Storage Management** <a href="#v35heo2vts1y" id="v35heo2vts1y"></a>

At reNEW, researchers must ensure that **storage planning and security measures** are integrated at every stage of the data lifecycle:

### **1. Plan & Design Stage** <a href="#hqdn7d22emjs" id="hqdn7d22emjs"></a>

Develop a **Data Storage Plan** outlining:

* Storage options
* Backup strategies
* Access controls
* Data classification and risk assessment (mandatory before data collection)\
  This ensures that legal, ethical, and security requirements are addressed immediately.\


### **2. Collect & Create Stage** <a href="#ovi7fqrloevh" id="ovi7fqrloevh"></a>

As you acquire or generate data (e.g., imaging, genomic, patient-derived data), consider:

* Secure data transfer and ingestion
* Protection of sensitive information
* Version control and documentation
* Compliance with **UCPH Information Security Policy** and GDPR\


### **3. Analyze & Process Stage** <a href="#d601rndic8ap" id="d601rndic8ap"></a>

Data analysis can require:

* Updated storage and backup strategies
* High-performance or specialized storage for large-scale analyses
* Security controls to prevent unauthorized access
* Traceable workflows for reproducibility\


### **4. Evaluate & Archive Stage** <a href="#h432w187gpkp" id="h432w187gpkp"></a>

At project completion:

* Choose suitable repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Dataverse) for sharing
* Plan long-term preservation to ensure access and transparency.
* Consider confidentiality and ethical sharing of sensitive data.a\


## **Information Security and GDPR Compliance** <a href="#chxavlc5zirb" id="chxavlc5zirb"></a>

Handling **personal or sensitive data** is common in biomedical research. Researchers at reNEW must:

* Comply with the [**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/personal-data/Pages/default.aspx)
* Adhere to UCPHâ€™s[ **Information Security Policy for Researchers**](https://informationssikkerhed.ku.dk/english/is-policy/)
* Apply appropriate access controls, encryption, and secure transmission protocols.
* Conduct [**data classification**](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/information-security-for-researchers/Pages/default.aspx#collapseMSOZoneCell_WebPartWPQ6) **and** [**risk assessments**](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/personal-data/impact-assessment/Pages/default.aspx) before data collection.
* Use only approved UCPH infrastructure for sensitive data.\
