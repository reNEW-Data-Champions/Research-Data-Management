## **Analyze and Collaborate Stage**

The **Analyze and Collaborate** stage focuses on **inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data** to generate insights, draw conclusions, and support research decision‑making. The practices and choices made at this stage directly influence both the **quality of analysis** and the **long‑term usability of your research data**.

## **Key best practices include:**

1. **Document Every Step of Analysis**
   * Record all processing and transformation steps to ensure your analysis is **reproducible and transparent**.
   * Use **Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs)**, **collaborative tools**, or **workflow‑tracking software** (e.g., Jupyter, R Markdown, Galaxy, or OMERO for imaging) to capture:
     * Scripts, pipelines, and commands used
     * Software versions and dependencies
     * Any parameters or filtering applied
   * Well‑documented workflows are **essential for FAIR data**, UCPH’s Open Science principles, and **EU funder compliance** with reproducibility standards.
2. **Ensure Data Safety and Organization**
   * Describe and annotate datasets as analyzed, maintaining **clear folder structures and file naming conventions**.
   * Store data in **secure and approved UCPH or reNEW storage solutions** (e.g., **ERDA, high‑security servers, or SharePoint for collaboration**).
   * Be mindful that some applications produce **proprietary file formats**; **export or save in open formats** (e.g., CSV, TIFF, JSON) to facilitate future reuse and interoperability.
   * Work only with **analysis‑ready datasets**, separating raw data from processed versions to protect original files.
3. **Facilitate Collaboration and Sharing**
   * Use **controlled, collaborative platforms** to share intermediate data with reNEW colleagues and external partners.
   * Establish explicit permissions and version control to prevent data loss or accidental overwriting.
   * Following these practices supports **seamless internal collaboration** and compliance with **GDPR** for personal or sensitive data, and aligns with **Horizon Europe and ERC data management expectations** for reproducibility and sharing.

By rigorously documenting, safeguarding, and standardizing your analysis processes, your team enhances **data integrity, research transparency, and readiness for eventual publication or repository deposition**.
