# ðŸŸ  RODMM Framework

**The Research Open Data Management Matrix** is a comprehensive framework designed to support effective research data management throughout its lifecycle, adhering to Open Science and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. It is structured around the key stages of the data lifecycle and incorporates essential data management practices.

At each stageâ€”collection, processing, analysis, preservation, and sharingâ€”the Matrix provides actionable guidance to ensure data remains FAIR. It emphasizes the adoption of open data practices, advocating for unrestricted access to research data, enabling its reuse and repurposing by the wider research community.

A central component of the Matrix is its focus on robust data governance. This encompasses developing and enforcing policies, procedures, and standards that ensure high data quality, privacy, security, and compliance with regulatory requirements. These measures foster the production of accurate, reliable, and ethically managed data, reinforcing trust and accountability in research.

The Research Open Data Management Matrix is a vital tool for researchers and data managers, enabling informed decision-making throughout the data lifecycle. Promoting efficient, transparent, and reproducible research cultivates a culture of openness and collaboration, ultimately advancing scientific discovery and benefiting the global research community.
