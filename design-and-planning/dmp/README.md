## What is a DMP?

\
A DMP (Data Management Plan) is a formal document outlining how data will be handled throughout a research project. It ensures that data is managed effectively, remains accessible, and complies with institutional, funding, and legal requirements. Institutions and funding agencies, especially those emphasizing open science and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles, often require DMPs

If you need personalized assistance with developing your DMP or with any aspect of research data management, don't hesitate to contact <mark style="color:red;">**Richard Dennis**</mark>. On-site consultations are available every Wednesday from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM or by appointment.
