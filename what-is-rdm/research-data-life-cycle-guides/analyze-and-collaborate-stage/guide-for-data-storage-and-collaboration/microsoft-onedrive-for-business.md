Microsoft OneDrive for Business is a cloud storage solution that allows users to share up to 5TB of research data with colleagues and external partners. OneDrive meets UCPH's information security standards for non-sensitive and non-confidential data. It is the recommended cloud solution for sharing data, as a data processing agreement between UCPH and Microsoft ensures adherence to the university's information security requirements. Other cloud providers like Dropbox do not have such agreements with UCPH.
