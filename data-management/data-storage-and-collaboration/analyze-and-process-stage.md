# Analyze & Process Stage

Researchers work with their datasets in the Analyze & Process stage to derive insights and draw conclusions. During this phase, data storage management remains crucial, as data may be transformed or aggregated, necessitating storage and backup strategies updates. Additionally, researchers may need to consider the storage requirements of analytical tools and the potential need for specialized, high-performance storage solutions to accommodate large-scale or computationally intensive analyses.
