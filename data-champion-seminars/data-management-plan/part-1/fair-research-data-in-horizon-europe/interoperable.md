# Interoperable

### I1. Use OPEN FILE FORMATS as much as possible

\= Formats that can be used and implemented by anyone

#### Examples

CSV for tabular data

RTF for textual data

TIFF for images

NetCDF for geospatial data

#### Please note:

* If you cannot share your data in an open format, provide information on how data sets can be opened
* Take into account the formatâ€™s obsolescence
* You may consider sharing in multiple formats

### I2. Use STANDARDS common in the discipline / for the data type

#### For example:

**Minimum information:**  metadata that, as a minimum, should be included to describe a data set

**Vocabularies**: predefined and authorized terms for metadata

**Taxonomies**: organization of content into hierarchical relationships

**Ontologies**: definitions and relations between metadata elements
