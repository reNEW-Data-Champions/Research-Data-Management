# The DMP Template: Interoperable

Making data interoperable

What data and metadata vocabularies, standards, formats  or methodologies will you follow to make your data  interoperable to allow data exchange and re-use within  and across disciplines? Will you follow community-  endorsed interoperability best practices? Which ones?

{% hint style="info" %}
What will you do to standardize your data  set as much as possible?

* What disciplinary standards will you use?
* Or: How do your home-built ontologies  relate to other disciplinary ontologies?
{% endhint %}

In case it is unavoidable that you use uncommon or  generate project specific ontologies or vocabularies, will  you provide mappings to more commonly used  ontologies? Will you openly publish the generated  ontologies or vocabularies to allow reusing, refining or  extending them?

Will your data include qualified references  to other data  (e.g. other data from your project, or datasets from  previous research)?

{% hint style="info" %}
Show how your data relate to other data (code, publications, interview guides, standard codebooks). Where possible, refer to these data using persistent identifiers.
{% endhint %}

**Interoperable is about:**

* Standards for describing data
* File format
