# Data Management Plan Assessment (H2020)

* REA \* project officers and/or external reviewers review the DMP.
* REA project officers use an assessment grid corresponding to the H2020 template.
* DMP needs to demonstrate your strategy for data management, with consensus between project members. It is not a sales pitch!
* PO might give feedback (or not).
* PO might request you to resubmit DMP if the information is missing or your strategy for data management is unclear.
