# What is a Data Champion?

### Have you heard of the term "Data Champion"?

It's a program inspired by the University of Cambridge and has successfully provided disciplinary-specific Research Data Management (RDM) support and a similar program was launched at reNEW.

### So, what exactly is a Data Champion?

It's an effective way to offer RDM support to all eight reNEW research groups by assigning a designated expert to each group. We have eight Data Champions volunteering their time, effort, and expertise to support RDM efforts at reNEW.\


The number of Data Champions will increase as the program is expanded.
