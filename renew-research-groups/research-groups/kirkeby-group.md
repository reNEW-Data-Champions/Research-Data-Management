# Kirkeby Group

## [Group research](https://renew.ku.dk/research/reseach-groups/kirkeby-group/#collapse-1582021919959)

The human brain is a highly complex structure consisting of hundreds of different subtypes of neural cells, each fulfilling a specific function in the brain network. However, experimental evidence regarding the development of the human brain is highly restricted due to the limited availability of fetal brain tissue â€“ instead, smaller model organisms have classically been applied for neurodevelopmental studies. The Kirkeby lab uses advanced human stem cell models to understand how hundreds of human neuronal subtypes are formed during embryo development. This knowledge enables us with new tools to produce and study human neurons in the lab for disease modeling, drug screening, and transplantation therapies for brain diseases.
