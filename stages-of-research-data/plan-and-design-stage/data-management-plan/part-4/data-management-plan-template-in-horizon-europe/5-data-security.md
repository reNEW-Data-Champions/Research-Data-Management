5\. Data security

What provisions are or will be in place for data security (including data recovery and secure storage/archiving and transfer of sensitive data)?

Will the data be safely stored in trusted repositories for long term preservation and curation?

**Tip 1: Determining data storage and security approach:**

1. Always start with a data classification
   1. What data will I work with?
   2. Are these data sensitive? confidential? potentially patentable?
2. Then conduct a risk assessment for the solution you have in mind.  What could go wrong? Is there a risk that...
   1.  ...unauthorized people get access to the data?

       ...data/materials are lost or misplaced?

       ...data/materials are altered without you knowing?

       ...data become inaccessible for shorter or longer periods?
3. Identify the consequence for the researcher, project and workplace/company etc. if the above happens? The larger the consequence the more you should focus on security.
4. When designing a secure set-up for data storage, consider:
   1. The IT solution to store and back up the digital data AND
   2. Any physical measures you should take AND
   3. Your procedures (behavior) when handling the data AND
   4. Who should have which responsibility for data storage in collaborative projects

**Q: What provisions are in place for data security (including data recovery, secure storage, and transfer of sensitive data)?**

**Example answer (non-sensitive data sets)**

“I will store the master copy of my data behind a firewall on university servers. Here, they will be automatically backed up and therefore be retrievable in case of accidental data loss.”

**Example answer (sensitive data sets)**

“Digital data sets, as well as the associated documentation that identifies the participants in the study (ID key), are stored on a secure university drive (S drive) where all activities are logged. Only project participants can access the digital data files, and only the project PI can access the ID key. A subset of the samples will be sent to German university X for analysis Y using the Sensitive Information Facility (SIF), a secure platform for sharing sensitive data at UCPH. A data processing agreement will be set up, specifying the security requirements the German university must have to manage our samples.”
