# FAIR Research Data in Horizon Europe

* Establish a Data Management Plan (DMP).
* Make data and metadata FAIR. Deposit data in a ‘trusted’ repository.
* Provide open access to deposited data and documentation.
* Justify any reasons for not making data openly available in the DMP.

**“As open as possible, as closed as necessary.”**

* Legal and contractual obligations/constraints (GDPR, NDAs, copyright)
* Commercial exploitation (IPR, patents)
* Ethical considerations (sensitivity, confidentiality)

The FAIR Data Principles are guidelines for making research data, code, digital objects, and documentations Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

Drafted by researchers, funders, and publishers in 2016, described in the [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618): “The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and Stewardship.”

Please note:

* Open data = Open Access to data = depositing data in a data repository from where they can freely be downloaded.
* FAIR data ≠ Open data!
* All open data must be FAIR, but not all FAIR data must be open.
