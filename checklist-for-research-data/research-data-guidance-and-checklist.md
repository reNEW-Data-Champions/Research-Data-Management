### Research Data Management:

Research Data Management (RDM) provides the strategies, guidelines, and measures to manage research outputs. Like a Jigsaw, RDM requires multiple pieces of multidisciplinary knowledge and competencies. This RDM Checklist guides the researchers to address the research outputs along the project lifecycle FAIRly and beyond. Because research projects are inherently iterative in their try-and-error phases, RDM is a continuous adapting process throughout the research project. Data Management Planning (DMP) is the operational tool to handle this complexity dynamically, in a structured way, ensuring compliance with policies and best practices. &#x20;

Find out more about RDM on the [University of Copenhagen Research Portal](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/Pages/default.aspx).

### Research Data Guidance and Checklist:

The research data lifecycle (Figure 1) is a model that illustrates the stages of data management and describes how data flow through a research project from start to finish. Data management involves deciding and documenting how data will be collected, organized, stored, and shared.

The Research Data Lifecycle represents stages in your research regarding how data is collected, used, and stored. At the core is how to "**Store & Manage**" the data for your project. How data is managed is integral to each Stage in the diagram. Though the process is linear from "**Plan & Design**" to "**Access & Reuse**," you may jump around this lifecycle throughout your project.

The RDM Checklist is a reference to keep track of the elements that make up good research data management throughout the RDM lifecycle (Figure 1). The RDM lifecycle is not linear, and you may find yourself jumping around this lifecycle throughout your project. You may also enter a project at various stages along the lifecycle. This document will help you start integrating data management into your research practice. Using the section prompts, you can identify gaps and communicate data management elements to your research team members. You should apply this checklist to an individual research project, as practices and procedures may vary between projects.

### Why is Research Data Management important?

There are a host of reasons why research data management is essential:

* Data (primarily digital data) is fragile and easily lost.
* There are growing research data requirements imposed by funders and publishers.
* Research data management saves time and resources overall.
* Good governance helps to prevent errors and increases the quality of your analyses.
* Well-managed and accessible data allows others to validate and replicate findings.

Research data management facilitates sharing of research data, and when shared, data can lead to valuable discoveries by others outside the original research team. Please note that this resource does not cover every single aspect of RDM. Certain data management practices specific to your research, your type(s) of data, and your needs are not covered. It is also possible that certain items will not apply to the specific type(s) of data you are working with.
