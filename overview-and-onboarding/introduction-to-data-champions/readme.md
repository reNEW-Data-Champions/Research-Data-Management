## Data Champions at reNEW

The reNEW Data Champions are a dedicated group of volunteers embedded within research groups who are vital in advancing best practices in Research Data Management (RDM). They serve as local expertise points and provide tailored guidance and resources to help their colleagues address the practical and ethical complexities of data stewardship. Their work ensures that research teams at reNEW maintain high standards in organizing, storing, and sharing data, fully aligning with institutional policies, legal obligations, funder mandates, and established best practices. By embedding FAIR principlesâ€”making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusableâ€”into everyday workflows, the Data Champions help safeguard research integrity, improve reproducibility, and enhance the broader visibility and impact of reNEW's scientific outputs.

Beyond technical support, the reNEW Data Champions foster a collaborative research culture grounded in shared knowledge and mutual learning. They facilitate peer-to-peer discussions, organize training opportunities, and promote adopting standardized RDM practices that streamline research processes and improve data quality. As advocates for open science, they encourage responsible data sharing and transparency, helping to position reNEW research within the global movement toward more accessible and reproducible science. In doing so, they not only support the success of individual projects but also contribute to the long-term sustainability and societal value of the research conducted at reNEW.
