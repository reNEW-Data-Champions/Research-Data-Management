{% hint style="info" %}
The reNEW Data Champions (DCs) serve as volunteer advisors, guiding their research group on best practices for managing research data. They champion robust research data management (RDM) and ardently support the FAIR research principles, ensuring data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

Data Champions establish a collaborative network within the reNEW Group at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Medicine. Moreover, they remain receptive to forging collaborations beyond the confines of the University.&#x20;

The resources available on this website have a clear objective: to enhance and fortify the Data Champion Program at reNEW, particularly in Research Data Management.
