# ðŸ”´ Data Champions Program





{% hint style="info" %}
The Data Champions initiative, originally conceived at the University of Cambridge, has been meticulously adapted to the distinctive context of the reNEW Research Group at the University of Copenhagen. Within this specialized environment, reNEW Data Champions (DCs) assume pivotal roles as voluntary advisors, leading their respective research groups in adopting exemplary practices for research data management. Their advocacy for rigorous RDM and unwavering support for the FAIR research principles is paramount, ensuring that data remains Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

As Data Champions, they are instrumental in establishing and nurturing a collaborative network within the diverse landscape of the reNEW Group at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Medicine. Their role is not confined merely to internal operations; they are also keenly open to exploring and initiating collaborations beyond the university's boundaries. This openness facilitates the exchange of best practices, experiences, and knowledge, enriching the research data management culture both within and outside the institution.
