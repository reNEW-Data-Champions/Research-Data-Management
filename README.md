## Introduction to Data Champions at reNEW

The reNEW Data Champions are dedicated volunteers committed to guiding researchers at the University of Copenhagen in all aspects of Research Data Management (RDM). Their primary aim is to help reNEW research groups organize, store, and share data effectively, ensuring alignment with institutional policies, legal requirements, and best practices.

By emphasizing the FAIR principlesâ€”findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusableâ€”the Data Champions enable researchers to implement structured data management strategies that enhance the quality, accessibility, and longevity of their research outputs.

## Building a Strong Data Management Network

Within reNEW, the Data Champions cultivate a collaborative support network that spans diverse research groups. They assist researchers in navigating data management challenges and encourage adopting standardized, efficient practices. By facilitating improved data organization and accessibility, they:

* **Enhance research reproducibility and integrity.**
* **Encourage collaboration and data sharing** across research groups.
* **Ensure that research data remains a valuable and sustainable asset** to the reNEW community.

Through these efforts, the Data Champions strengthen reNEW's research environment, making data management more efficient, structured, and impactful.
