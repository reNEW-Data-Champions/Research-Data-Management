# ðŸŸ  Data Champions at reNEW

### **What are Data Champions at reNEW?**

The **reNEW Data Champions** are a team of volunteer researchers who provide **peer-to-peer support** in research data management (RDM). Their primary role is to help make data management more **accessible, consistent, and embedded** across the reNEW research community.

#### **Purpose and Function**

Data Champions serve as local RDM facilitators. They support colleagues by helping them understand, implement, and maintain responsible data management practices. This includes:

* **Assisting researchers to organise, store, and share data effectively**
* **Promoting compliance** with legal, institutional, and funder requirements
* **Supporting adoption of the FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
* **Collaborating with the Data Steward** and broader support infrastructure to embed good practices

#### **Why They Matter**

By fostering a culture of shared responsibility and continuous learning, the Data Champions play a critical role in:

* Enhancing **data integrity** and **research reproducibility**
* Encouraging **responsible data sharing**
* Ensuring the **long-term value and accessibility** of research outputs
* Promoting a **transparent and sustainable research environment** across the Node

Data Champions help bridge the gap between central RDM policy and day-to-day research practice, creating a more resilient and future-proof data ecosystem within reNEW.
