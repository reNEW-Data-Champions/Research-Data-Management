# ðŸ”µ Data Champions&#x20;



{% hint style="info" %}
The <mark style="color:blue;">**reNEW Data Champions**</mark> are volunteers dedicated to improving research data management within the reNEW Research Groups at the University of Copenhagen. Their primary role is to guide their groups in adopting better practices for organizing, storing, and sharing research data. Focusing on the FAIR principlesâ€”keeping data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusableâ€”they help ensure that research data is well-managed and supports high-quality science.

Within reNEW, Data Champions create a support network across research teams. They help researchers navigate data management challenges and align with shared standards. They also work to make research data easier to find and use, foster collaboration, and ensure that data remains an asset to the reNEW community. Their efforts strengthen reNEWâ€™s overall research environment, making it more efficient and impactful.
