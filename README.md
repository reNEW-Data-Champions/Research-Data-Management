# ðŸŸ  Data Champions at reNEW

## ðŸ§ª What Are Data Champions at reNEW?

**reNEW Data Champions** are volunteer researchers who provide peer-to-peer support in research data management (RDM). They aim to make responsible data practices more accessible, consistent, and embedded across the reNEW research community.

***

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose and Role

Data Champions act as local RDM facilitators within their groups. Working in close collaboration with the Data Steward and institutional support teams, they help colleagues:

* Organize, store, and share data effectively
* Navigate legal, institutional, and funder compliance requirements
* Apply the **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
* Integrate good data management into everyday research workflows

***

## ðŸŒ± Why They Matter

By fostering a culture of shared responsibility and continuous learning, Data Champions help:

* Strengthen data integrity and scientific reproducibility
* Encourage responsible, transparent data sharing
* Improve the long-term value, accessibility, and reuse of research outputs
* Bridge the gap between high-level RDM policy and daily research practice

Their contributions are central to building a sustainable, FAIR-aligned, and future-proof data ecosystem within reNEW.
