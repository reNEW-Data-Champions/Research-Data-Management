**Research Data Management (RDM)** refers to the organization, storage, preservation, and sharing of data collected and used during a research project. It involves establishing policies and procedures throughout the data lifecycle to ensure that research data are managed to enhance accessibility, reliability, and quality. This includes considerations for data collection, documentation, storage, backup, archiving, and sharing with the broader scientific community.

**Effective RDM ensures that data are:**

* **Findable:** Data should be easily located and accessed.
* **Accessible:** If necessary, data should be available to authorized users and systems with clearly defined access restrictions.
* **Interoperable:** Data should be presented in a format that can be used in different systems, ideally with standardized metadata to support integration with other datasets.
* **Reusable:** Data should be well-documented and maintained to ensure they can be used in the future by other researchers or for different research projects.

These principles, known as the FAIR principles, underpin good practice in RDM and are increasingly required by research funders and institutions to ensure that research outputs can have the broadest possible impact.

The Data Champions initiative, originally conceived at the University of Cambridge, has been meticulously adapted to the distinctive context of the reNEW Research Group at the University of Copenhagen. Within this specialized environment, reNEW Data Champions (DCs) assume pivotal roles as voluntary advisors, leading their respective research groups in adopting exemplary practices for research data management. Their advocacy for rigorous RDM and unwavering support for the FAIR research principles is paramount, ensuring that data remains Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

As Data Champions, they are instrumental in establishing and nurturing a collaborative network within the diverse landscape of the reNEW Group at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Medicine. Their role is not confined merely to internal operations; they are also keenly open to exploring and initiating collaborations beyond the university's boundaries. This openness facilitates the exchange of best practices, experiences, and knowledge, enriching the research data management culture both within and outside the institution.
