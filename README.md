# ðŸ”µ Data Champions at reNEW

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Data Champions at reNEW: Supporting Research Data Management**</mark>					&#x9;

The **reNEW Data Champions** are dedicated volunteers who support researchers within their respective research groups, assisting them in finding resources that enhance their data management practices. Their primary role is to guide reNEW research groups in **organizing, storing, and sharing data effectively**, ensuring compliance with institutional policies, legal requirements, and best practices. Data Champions help streamline Research Data Management (RDM) processes by providing targeted support, making data more accessible, secure, and aligned with FAIR principles.

By emphasizing the FAIR principlesâ€”Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusableâ€”the Data Champions enable researchers to implement structured data management strategies that enhance the quality, accessibility, and longevity of their research outputs.

Building a Strong Data Management Network

Within reNEW, the Data Champions cultivate a collaborative support network that spans diverse research groups. They assist researchers in navigating data management challenges and encourage the adopting of standardized, efficient practices. By facilitating improved data organization and accessibility, they:

* **Enhance research reproducibility and integrity.**
* **Encourage collaboration and data sharing** across research groups.
* **Ensure that research data remains a valuable and sustainable asset** to the reNEW community.

The Data Champions strengthen reNEWâ€™s research environment through these efforts, making data management more efficient, structured, and impactful.
