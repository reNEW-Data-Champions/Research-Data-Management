## <mark style="color:blue;">**What is the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)?**</mark>

&#x20;

The <mark style="color:blue;">**European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)**</mark> is the European Commission's (EC) flagship initiative aimed at creating a federated, open, and seamless digital ecosystem for managing and sharing research data and services across Europe. It provides a trusted environment where researchers, innovators, companies, and citizens can access, manage, and reuse research data, tools, and services. By fostering Open Science, EOSC accelerates innovation, enhances transparency, and improves the reproducibility of research outcomes. For researchers who receive EU funding, EOSC is both a valuable resource and a critical platform for fulfilling Open Science obligations, as it supports sharing data and scholarly outputs in compliance with European policies.

EOSC is grounded in the FAIR principles, ensuring data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. This approach maximizes the value of research outputs by making them discoverable and usable for future research. Researchers are encouraged to publish their datasets, publications, and software openly, increasing the visibility and impact of their work and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration. EOSC connects existing research infrastructures, repositories, and tools across Europe, providing seamless access to various resources.

The platform offers integrated services to support the entire research lifecycle. Researchers can use EOSC to develop Data Management Plans (DMPs), store and process large datasets, and publish their outputs in FAIR-compliant repositories. EOSC provides access to high-performance computing (HPC) and analytical tools, enabling data-intensive research. By facilitating collaboration and enabling access to data from multiple scientific disciplines, EOSC fosters interdisciplinary research and innovation.

For EU-funded projects, EOSC is particularly essential. The platform ensures compliance with Open Science policies under programs like Horizon Europe, which mandate the open sharing of data and research outputs. EOSC provides researchers with the infrastructure and tools to manage and preserve their data effectively. By contributing to EOSC, researchers not only meet funding requirements but also help to build a more transparent and collaborative scientific community.

EOSC aims to promote Open Science, ensuring that scientific data is openly available to foster collaboration, accelerate innovation, and enhance the transparency and reproducibility of research. It adheres to the FAIR principlesâ€”ensuring data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusableâ€”to maximize the value of research outputs.

&#x20;

## <mark style="color:blue;">**The History and Development of EOSC**</mark>

&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">**1. Origins and Concept (2015-2016)**</mark>

The European Open Science Cloud concept was first introduced in the European Commission's 2015 Communication on the European Digital Single Market. The idea was further developed in the EC's 2016 report, European Cloud Initiative.

&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Key Objectives at Inception:**</mark>

1. Provide European researchers with a unified data storage, sharing, and analysis platform.
2. Address the fragmentation of existing research infrastructures and data repositories.
3. Support the EU's broader Digital Single Market Strategy.

&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">**2. Initial Development and Stakeholder Engagement (2016-2017)**</mark>

In 2016, the European Commission launched the first consultations and working groups to define the scope and structure of EOSC. This phase included:

1. Stakeholder Engagement: Engaging with researchers, institutions, and data service providers to identify key needs and challenges.
2. Policy Foundations: Emphasizing the importance of Open Science and FAIR data principles.

&#x20;

The EOSC High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) was established to provide strategic guidance, culminating in the 2016 report Realizing the European Open Science Cloud, which laid out a vision for EOSC.

&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">**3. Launch of EOSC and Initial Implementation (2018)**</mark>

The official launch of EOSC took place in November 2018 during the Austrian EU Presidency. This marked the beginning of its implementation phase, with a focus on:

1. Developing a governance framework.
2. Building the technical infrastructure to connect national and European research data infrastructures.

&#x20;

The launch was accompanied by the EOSC Declaration, signed by key stakeholders to signal commitment to its principles and goals.

&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">**4. Early Operational Phase (2019-2020)**</mark>

Following the launch, the EC and its partners worked to establish the foundational components of EOSC:

&#x20;<mark style="color:blue;">**EOSC Governance Framework:**</mark> A tripartite structure was set up, including:

&#x20;<mark style="color:blue;">**EOSC Governance Board:**</mark> Representing EU member states and associated countries.

&#x20;<mark style="color:blue;">**EOSC Executive Board:**</mark> Comprising stakeholders responsible for driving implementation.

&#x20;<mark style="color:blue;">**EOSC Stakeholder Forum:**</mark> Providing input and feedback from the research community.

&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Initial Projects:**</mark>&#x20;

Several EU-funded projects (e.g., EOSCpilot, EOSC-hub, FREYA) were launched to build technical components and test the feasibility of EOSC services.

&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">**5. Transition and Expansion (2021-Present)**</mark>

In 2021, EOSC entered its expansion phase to scale up and integrate more research infrastructures, data services, and users.
