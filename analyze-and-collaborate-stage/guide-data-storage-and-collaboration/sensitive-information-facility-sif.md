### [Electronic Research Data Archive (ERDA)](https://www.erda.dk/)

UCPH's Sensitive Information Facility (SIF) is designed for storing and sharing sensitive information, including personal data. SIF enables secure sharing with other project participants, including collaborators outside UCPH. Users must adhere to several GDPR requirements before sharing data with external collaborators. The SCIENCE HPC Center provides SIF as a service for employees at UCPH's Faculty of Science, but its use by all UCPH employees is under consideration. SIF is suitable for the storage and sharing of sensitive data, including confidential and personal data.
