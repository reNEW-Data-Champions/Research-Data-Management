# Introduction

Effective data storage management is a crucial component of the [Research Data Lifecycle](https://data-champions.renew-platforms.dk/renew-data-champions/guide-for-research-data-management). Information security is pivotal in safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access, misuse, disclosure, modification, destruction, or loss. By addressing storage considerations at each stage of the process, researchers can ensure the security, integrity, and accessibility of their data, ultimately contributing to more rigorous, reproducible, and impactful research outcomes.

The importance of having robust research data management (RDM) infrastructure cannot be overstated, as it helps to prevent data loss and ensure compliance with data protection regulations such as the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/personal-data/Pages/default.aspx) Implementing [RDM best practices,](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/Pages/default.aspx) such as [data classification](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/information-security-for-researchers/Pages/default.aspx#collapseMSOZoneCell\_WebPartWPQ6) and [risk assessments,](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/personal-data/impact-assessment/Pages/default.aspx) allows researchers to identify and mitigate potential risks and vulnerabilities related to their data.

Additionally, adhering to the UCPH [Information Security Policy for Researchers](https://informationssikkerhed.ku.dk/english/is-policy/) further strengthens the protection of sensitive information. These guidelines encompass various security measures, such as access controls, encryption, and secure data transmission protocols, essential for maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In summary, by incorporating RDM infrastructure, GDPR compliance, data classification, risk assessments, and information security best practices, researchers can effectively protect their data and contribute to the overall success of their research endeavors.
