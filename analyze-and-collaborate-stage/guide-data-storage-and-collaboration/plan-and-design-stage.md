In the Plan & Design stage, researchers are often required to develop a Data Storage Plan. This plan outlines specific details concerning data storage throughout the project, such as storage options, backup strategies, and access control measures. By carefully considering these factors, researchers can ensure that their projects adhere to data security best practices and relevant legal and ethical requirements.
