# The DMP Template: Reusable

Increase data re-use

How will you provide documentation needed to validate data  analysis and facilitate data re-use (e.g. readme files with  information on methodology, codebooks, data cleaning,  analyses, variable definitions, units of measurement, etc.)?

{% hint style="info" %}
What information is necessary for others to understand the data and repeat the project? How will you make this info available?
{% endhint %}

Will your data be made freely available in the public domain to  permit the widest re-use possible? Will your data be licensed  using standard reuse licenses, in line with the obligations set out  in the Grant Agreement?

{% hint style="info" %}
Do you have conditions for reuse? Who can reuse  your data? Will you use a standard license (e.g. CC) to communicate these conditions?

* Repositories often allow you to choose a  license when you upload data
{% endhint %}

Will the data produced in the project be useable by third parties,  in particular after the end of the project?

Will the provenance of the data be thoroughly documented  using the appropriate standards?

{% hint style="info" %}
Provenance: history of what happened to the data until now. Part of the metadata.
{% endhint %}

Describe all relevant data quality assurance processes.

{% hint style="info" %}
What did you to ensure the quality of the data?  How will you add that info? e.g. Peer review of  project plan, interview guides, code, data.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria. Pilot studies.  Calibration of equipment. Controls, etc.
{% endhint %}

**Reusability is about:**

* Providing information so others understand your data
* Providing information so that others  understand how to reuse your data
