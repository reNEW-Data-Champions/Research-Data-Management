# Research Data Management in Horizon Europe

* **Funders** have set conditions for the proper management of data (e.g., submission of RDM plans)&#x20;
* **Journals** have policies regarding research data availability
* **Funders often provide their template**, including data management guidelines. More and more often, university templates are accepted.

In Horizon Europe, beneficiaries must manage their research data in line with the FAIR principles:

* Establish and maintain a Data Management Plan (DMP).
* Justify reasons for not making data openly available.
* Deposit data in a trusted repository.
* Follow applicable metadata standards.
* Assign persistent identifiers and user licenses.

Participants must provide information about other research outputs, tools, and instruments to re-use or validate the data.
