# Reusable

### R1. Create sufficient DOCUMENTATION that explains the data. Make this documentation available along with the data.

### Data provenance

A record trail following the data from its origin to its current form: Origin of the data, who contributed to the data, how many versions there are, etc.

### Research documentation

The information necessary, and the appropriate level of detail, so that others can repeat the study: protocol, description of variables, choice of statistics, etc.

### Open-source code/software

If relevant and possible, include open-source code or software in your data.
