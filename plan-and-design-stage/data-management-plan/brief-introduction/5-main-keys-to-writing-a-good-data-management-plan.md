# 5 Main Keys to Writing a Good Data Management Plan

**FAIR Principles:** Adhere to the FAIR regulations (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) when creating your DMP. These principles promote the optimal use and reusability of research data, benefiting your project and the wider research community. Ensure that your DMP includes clear strategies for making your data findable (e.g., by assigning unique identifiers), accessible (e.g., by using open access repositories), interoperable (e.g., by adopting standard data formats and vocabularies), and reusable (e.g., by providing clear licenses and documentation).

**Clear data organization and documentation:** A well-structured DMP should provide detailed information about the types of data you will collect, generate, or reuse, the methods and tools you will use to collect and analyze the data, and how you will store and preserve the data. Include information about metadata standards, data formats, and file naming conventions to ensure consistency and facilitate data sharing.

**Data sharing and ethical considerations:** Your DMP should address data sharing policies and practices, including any restrictions on data sharing due to legal, ethical, or commercial concerns. Be transparent about the conditions under which your data will be made available to others, and describe the procedures for granting access to the data. Address any data protection and privacy issues, mainly when dealing with sensitive or personal data. Ensure that your DMP complies with relevant data protection regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and includes strategies for obtaining informed consent from data subjects, anonymizing data, and securely storing and transferring data.

**Data storage and preservation:** Outline your strategies for secure and long-term data storage and press protections, including selecting appropriate storage solutions (e.g., institutional repositories, domain-specific repositories, or general-purpose repositories) that meet the FAIR principles. Specify the data retention periods for different types of data, considering both the requirements of Horizon Europe and the research community's needs. Also, provide a plan for data backup and disaster recovery to minimize the risk of data loss.

**Roles and responsibilities:** Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of all project team members involved in data management, including data collection, processing, storage, and sharing. Assign a dedicated data manager or data steward to oversee the implementation of the DMP and ensure that data management practices are followed consistently throughout the project. Include training and capacity-building plans to ensure all team members have the necessary skills and expertise to manage the data effectively.

A **data management plan (DMP)** is essential to any research project funded by Horizon Europe. It helps ensure that the research data is collected, stored, and shared responsibly and efficiently.

By incorporating these **five primary keys** into your **data management plan**, you can ensure that your research project complies with Horizon Europe's requirements and contributes to the broader goals of open science and research collaboration.
