# Example answer for Accessible

### Example answer (describing which datasets will not be shared and why)

“The different types of data that are generated during the project for the four demonstrator sites or for general purpose are open by default with the following general exceptions:

* **copyright and permissions for reusing third-party data sets**

Processing and combining input data from many different sources may lead to unclear IPR situations regarding the generated output data; therefore, such repurposed data (e.g., model output data) can only be made open if any of the underlying data (e.g., model input data) is open, too.

* **personal data treatment and confidentiality issues**

Datasets referring to the quality and quantity of specific elements at risk, such as people and critical infrastructures, are not open by default as their publication may pose privacy, ethical or security risks.

* **data-driven business model**

Data that is exploited commercially through the MyClimateService.eu marketplace will not be made open.“

* **Describing how access will be given using information provided by the repository.**

“Data and metadata will be made freely available via the repository Zenodo.

(Meta)data are retrievable using the open, free and universally implementable protocols OAI-PMH and REST API.

The metadata will be licensed under public domain (CC0) and no authorization is necessary to retrieve the metadata.&#x20;

Metadata will be accessible even if the data are no longer available, stored in high availability database servers at CERN. CERN guarantees a minimum storage period of 20 years for data and metadata.”
