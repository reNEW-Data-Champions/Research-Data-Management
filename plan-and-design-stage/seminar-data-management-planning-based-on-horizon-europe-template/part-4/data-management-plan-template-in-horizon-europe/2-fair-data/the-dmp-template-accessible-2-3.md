# The DMP template: Accessible (2/3)

### Making data accessible: Data.

Will all data be made openly available? If specific datasets cannot be shared (or need to be shared under restricted access conditions),  explain why, clearly separating legal and contractual reasons from intentional restrictions. Note that in multi-beneficiary projects, specific beneficiaries can keep their data closed if opening their data goes against their legitimate interests or other constraints as per the Grant Agreement.

{% hint style="info" %}
What data are made openly available, which data are not  available at all, and which data have restricted access?

* Lists datasets, their access methods reasoning for  choosing that access method.
{% endhint %}

If an embargo is applied to give time to publish or seek the protection of the intellectual property (e.g., patents), specify why and how long this will use, bearing in mind that research data should be made available as soon as possible.

{% hint style="info" %}
Embargo = a period of time in which the data is not available
{% endhint %}

Will the data be accessible through a free and standardized access protocol?

{% hint style="info" %}
Free standardized access protocol = easy web access protocol that is not proprietary.
{% endhint %}

If there are restrictions on use, how will access be provided to the data, both during and after the end of the project?

{% hint style="info" %}
In case of restricted access: What are the conditions for access? What is the procedure for verifying that these conditions are met? Who decides whether access is provided (person or group of persons)?
{% endhint %}

How will the identity of the person accessing the data be ascertained?

Is there a need for a data access committee (e.g., to evaluate/approve access requests to personal/sensitive data)?

**Accessible is about:**

* Repositories
* Making data accessible
* Making metadata accessible

**Translation:**

* What data are made openly available, which data are not available at all, and which data have restricted access?
  * Lists datasets, their access methods &   reasoning for choosing that access method.
* Embargo = a period of time in which the data is not available
* Free standardized access protocol = easy web access protocol that is not proprietary
* In case of restricted access:
  * What are the conditions for access?
  * What is the procedure for verifying that these conditions are met?
  * Who decides whether access is provided (person or group of persons)?
