### Making data accessible: Metadata

Will metadata be made openly available and licenced  under a public domain dedication CC0, as per the Grant  Agreement? If not, please clarify why. Will metadata  contain information to enable the user to access the data?

{% hint style="info" %}
CC0 for metadata = all rights waived. Metadata are openly available and freely reusable, no credit should be given. Default under Horizon Europe.
{% endhint %}

How long will the data remain available and findable?  Will metadata be guaranteed to remain available after  data is no longer available?

Will documentation or reference about any software be  needed to access or read the data be included? Will it be  possible to include the relevant software (e.g. in open  source code)?

{% hint style="info" %}
If specific software is needed to open the datasets, either include the software when you upload the data or refer to it in the metadata.
{% endhint %}
