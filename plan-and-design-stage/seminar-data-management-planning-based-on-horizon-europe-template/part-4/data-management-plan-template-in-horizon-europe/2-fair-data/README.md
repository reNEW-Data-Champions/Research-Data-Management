# 2 - FAIR Data

## The DMP Template: Findable

### Making data findable, including provisions for metadata

Will a persistent identifier identify data?

Will rich metadata be provided to allow discovery?  What metadata will be created? What disciplinary or general standards will be followed? If metadata standards do not exist in your discipline,  please outline what type of metadata will be created and how.

Will search keywords be provided in the metadata to optimize the possibility for discovery and then potential re-use?

Will metadata be offered so that it can be harvested and indexed?

#### Findable is about:

* Metadata, including persistent identifiers
* Making metadata searchable

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip 1 – Describe your metadata**

You are being asked about metadata repeatedly (also in I and R). Here, focus on metadata that aid findability.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip 2 – Keep your data repository of choice in mind when answering**

* Investigate what your repository can do to make data findable
* Does it offer an option to add a persistent  identifier to the data?
* Can you enter keywords?
* What is its policy to make metadata  searchable?
{% endhint %}
