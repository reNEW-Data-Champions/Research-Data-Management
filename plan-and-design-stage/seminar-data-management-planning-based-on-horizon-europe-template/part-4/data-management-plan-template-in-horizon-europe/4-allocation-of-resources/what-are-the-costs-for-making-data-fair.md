# What are the costs for making data FAIR?

### Example answer (costs for preservation)

“The main task to be undertaken to ensure data is FAIR, is the deposition of the final dataset with the Archaeology Data Service, estimated at 1200 euros. These archiving costs are one-off and cover the management and preservation of the dataset for eternity.”

### Example answer (costs for data management services)

“For the statistical analyses of WP2, we will employ a statistician at the University of Heidelberg. The costs for this will correspond to 2 days of full-time work, and will amount to approximately EUR xxx.”
