# 4 - Allocation of Resources

## The DMP Template: Allocation of resources

### 4. Allocation of resources

What will the costs be for making data or other research outputs FAIR in your project (e.g., direct and indirect costs related to storage, archiving, re-use,  security, etc.)?

{% hint style="info" %}
**Investigate costs at project start!**

* What additional resources are needed to  deliver your plan?
* Is additional specialist expertise (or training  for existing staff) required?
* Do you have sufficient storage and  equipment or do you need to pay for more?
* Will charges be applied by data repositories?
* Have you budgeted for time and effort to  prepare the data for sharing / preservation?
{% endhint %}

How will these be covered? Note that costs related to  research data/output management are eligible as part  of the Horizon Europe grant (if compliant with the  Grant Agreement conditions)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Discuss responsibilities with collaborators at  project start**

* Who covers any additional costs for data  management?
* Who manages the data during the project?
* Who curates the data after the project  (preservation)?
* Who is the contact person for the data?
* Who is responsible for ensuring that all  legal, ethical and contractual obligations are  upheld?
{% endhint %}

Who will be responsible for data management in your project?

How will long-term preservation be ensured? Discuss the necessary resources to accomplish this (costs and potential value, who decides and how, what data will be kept, and for how long).

{% hint style="info" %}
Where, how, in what format and how long will you preserve data after project end, what does this cost?
{% endhint %}
