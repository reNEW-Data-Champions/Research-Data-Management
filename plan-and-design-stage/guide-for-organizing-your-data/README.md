# Guide for Organizing Your Data

The research data lifecycle is a model that demonstrates the various stages of data management, showcasing data progression throughout a research project from inception to conclusion. Data management encompasses the planning and documenting of data collection, organization, storage, and sharing processes.

The Research Data Lifecycle outlines each research phase concerning data collection, utilization, and storage, with "Store & Manage" being the central component of your project. Effective data management is crucial at every stage of the diagram. Although the process appears linear, ranging from "Plan & Design" to "Access & Reuse," you may navigate these stages non-linearly as your project evolves.
