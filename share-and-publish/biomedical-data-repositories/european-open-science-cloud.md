# ðŸŸ  European Open Science Cloud

### What is the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)?

The **European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)** is the European Commissionâ€™s flagship initiative to build a **federated, open, and trusted digital ecosystem** for managing and sharing research data and services across Europe. Designed to support researchers, innovators, companies, and citizens, EOSC offers a seamless environment for **accessing, managing, and reusing** research data, tools, and services.

By fostering **Open Science practices**, EOSC aims to accelerate innovation, enhance transparency, and improve the **reproducibility** of research outcomes. It is particularly vital for **EU-funded research**, serving as a **valuable resource** and a **required platform** to help researchers meet Open Science obligations under policies such as Horizon Europe.

At its core, EOSC is **grounded in the FAIR principles**â€”ensuring data is **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable**. This approach maximizes the value of research outputs by making them discoverable and usable for future research. Researchers are encouraged to **publish datasets, publications, and software openly**, increasing their work's visibility, impact, and interdisciplinary reuse.

EOSC connects existing **research infrastructures, repositories, and services** across Europe into a unified, interoperable system, providing seamless access to a wide range of resources.

### Features and Services

EOSC offers integrated services that **support the entire research lifecycle**, including:

* **Data Management Plans (DMPs):** Tools to help researchers plan and document data handling in compliance with funder requirements.
* **Storage and Processing:** Capabilities for storing and analyzing large datasets securely.
* **FAIR-Compliant Publishing:** Services to publish datasets in repositories aligned with FAIR principles.
* **High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Analytical Tools:** Enabling complex, data-intensive research.
* **Collaboration Tools:** Facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration by providing access to data and services across scientific domains.

By integrating these services, EOSC promotes **collaboration**, **interdisciplinary research**, and **innovation** while ensuring compliance with European **Open Science policies**.

### Importance of EU-Funded Projects

For researchers funded by the EU, EOSC is essential for:

* **Meeting Open Science requirements:** Horizon Europe mandates open sharing of research outputs.
* **Ensuring data stewardship:** EOSC offers infrastructure and guidance for effective data management and long-term preservation.
* **Supporting transparency and reproducibility:** Open access to data strengthens scientific integrity.
* **Contributing to a collaborative European research environment:** By sharing data through EOSC, researchers help build a more open and interoperable research ecosystem.

### Key Objectives of EOSC

1. **Data Sharing and Reuse:** Cultivating a culture of making data openly available and reusable across disciplines to improve transparency and collaboration.
2. **Federated Infrastructure:** Integrating national and European data infrastructures, repositories, and services into a **unified platform**.
3. **Interoperability and Standards:** Promoting **common standards** ensures seamless compatibility across diverse scientific domains.
4. **Open Science Culture:** Supporting the transition to Open Science by encouraging **open access to data, publications, and collaborative tools**.

### History and Development of EOSC

#### 1. Origins and Concept (2015â€“2016)

* Introduced in the **European Digital Single Market Strategy (2015)**.
* Defined in the **2016 European Cloud Initiative**.
* Initial goals included:
  * Providing European researchers with a unified data storage, sharing, and analysis platform.
  * Reducing fragmentation across existing infrastructures.
  * Supporting the broader Digital Single Market Strategy.

#### 2. Initial Development and Stakeholder Engagement (2016â€“2017)

* First, consultations and working groups were launched to shape EOSC.
* Engagement with **researchers, institutions, and service providers** to identify needs.
* Emphasis on **Open Science** and **FAIR data** principles.
* Establishment of the **High-Level Expert Group (HLEG)**, whose 2016 report, _Realising the European Open Science Cloud,_ provided strategic guidance.

#### 3. Official Launch and Initial Implementation (2018)

* Officially launched in **November 2018** under the Austrian EU Presidency.
* Focus areas:
  * Establishing a **governance framework**.
  * Building technical infrastructure to connect national and European data services.
* Accompanied by the **EOSC Declaration**, signaling stakeholder commitment.

#### 4. Early Operational Phase (2019â€“2020)

* Creation of the **EOSC Governance Framework** with:
  * **Governance Board** (EU member states and associated countries).
  * **Executive Board** (stakeholders leading implementation).
  * **Stakeholder Forum** (broader research community input).
* Launch of **pilot projects** (e.g., EOSCpilot, EOSC-hub, FREYA) to test feasibility and build core services.

#### 5. Transition and Expansion (2021â€“Present)

* Scaling up and integrating more **research infrastructures and users**.
* Establishment of the **EOSC Association (2020)** to coordinate development and represent stakeholders from research institutions and service providers.
* Significant funding under **Horizon Europe (2021â€“2027)** to support growth and adoption.
* Publication of the **Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA, 2021)** outlining priorities for interoperability, data stewardship, and user engagement.

### Key Milestones

* **2015:** EOSC was introduced in the European Digital Single Market strategy.
* **2016:** High-Level Expert Group report sets out vision.
* **2018:** Official launch under Austriaâ€™s EU Presidency.
* **2019:** The governance framework and initial services were established.
* **2020:** The EOSC Association formed to lead development.
* **2021:** Launch of SRIA under Horizon Europe.
* **2023â€“present:** Ongoing expansion focusing on **sustainability, interoperability, and adoption**.

### Future Goals of EOSC

EOSCâ€™s long-term vision includes:

* **Full Integration:** Connecting all major European research infrastructures for seamless access to data and services across countries and disciplines.
* **Supporting Research Communities:** Providing tailored tools and platforms for diverse research domains.
* **Promoting Global Open Science:** Positioning Europe as a **leader** in Open Science and advancing global data-sharing efforts.
* **Sustainability:** Developing robust funding and operational models to ensure EOSCâ€™s long-term viability beyond initial EU support.
